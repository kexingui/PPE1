<p>Normally, the treatment of literary or theoretical texts relies
on some kind of configuration of a text's content and the formal
patterns put together within an already established context.
Although the organising principles may vary considerably, the
technique always comes down to a set of connections that are held
together by the text.</p><p>These connections can be explicitly causal, building up the
narrative, or associative not following a linear logic so that the
only way to make the connection is to follow the intentions of the
author. Our world or culture happens to organise things in a way
that means that explicitly causal arguments are evidence of
scientific, critical or documentary writings, while intentional,
associative and often-fragmented connections are understood as
signs of artistic literature. Pursuing these stereotypical
assumptions, one finds that criticism, science and documentation
are linked to an external public while the literary artistic text
is associated - at least since the 19th century - with an
internalised, private subjectivity. To write an 'objective',
'distant' and therefore 'cold' poetic text is still perceived as a
somewhat transgressive act, just as criteria like 'taste' or
similar seemingly subjective terms provoke confusion when used in
scientific analysis. While today, in the field of writing, those
borders are still amazingly intact; in the visual field there has
been a much stronger amalgamation, at least on the artistic side.
Conceptual and installation art have steadily eroded the division
between 'subjective' art and 'objective' science and in many
current forms of <em>Kontextkunst</em> it seems to have disappeared
entirely. Another indication of developments in the visual arts is
the role of critics and curators, who, for many conservatives, is
simply not distinguished enough from the role of the artist him or
herself, while at the same time artists are pilloried for writing
theoretical and critical texts.</p><p>Many of Frances Stark's essays are uncertainly located between
cultural criticism and poetry, placing her within an established
tradition of other visual artists such as the Danish Cobra member
Asger Jørn or Franz West. Jørn defined his own form of science in
his writings, doing so in order to turn it into a publicly
accessible concept. Franz West took apart texts by Lacan and
Wittgenstein in order to re-examine the individual parts in terms
of both their content and formal qualities. Such texts by visual
artists often appear hybridised or as samples that avoid
classification as one particular genre of writing. One reason for
the ease with which artists can mix genres might relate to the way
collage and over-painting are already taken for granted in
modernist art. However, an individual like Frances Stark is not
simply a visual artist who writes, everything we know makes it
clear that her writing is of equal value to her visual production.
In conversations with the artist I noticed very early on one her
particular habit of continuously reading other writers. While the
process of reading a literary or scientific text would normally
come to some kind of end or even a final 'over and done with', for
Stark reading is just the beginning of further re-readings and
re-contextualisations to be repeated over and over again. These
readings create a permanent new language, a fusion between her text
and the other that becomes impossible to separate because both are
parts of the same architecture. In one of her columns in
<em>Artext</em> titled 'Knowledge Evanescent' it first seems
possible to identify a line of thought leading from one quote to
the other, from Rudolf Steiner to J.D. Salinger, and all the way to
Gurdjieff. However, this quotational level of the text is regularly
interrupted by various biographical reflections mixing her own
thoughts on various literary figures with reactions to her students
and her own personal story. It becomes less and less clear if one
level determines the other or if everything has already flowed
together. A footnote becomes a reminder to the author herself to
read a text, while her situation as a teacher overlaps with a TV
series about an art student. She first hears the art student in the
background of a phone conversation with her gallerist and later
learns about her progress from her real art students. On points
like this fiction and theory intertwine with her biography to such
an extent that it is impossible to identify a beginning or end
anymore. Nevertheless the title of the essay can't just be taken
literally - knowledge rather manifests itself in fleeting
disappearances between all the different levels.</p><p>These various levels become even more obvious in the book
<em>The Architect & The Housewife</em> where they are located
in the dichotomies between public and private, outside and inside,
male and female. This is a book about the essential questions of
modernism. In the beginning, it quotes Oscar Wilde's <em>The Artist
as a Critic</em>: 'If you wish to understand others you must
intensify your own individualism' - private differentiation as a
pre-condition for an outside understanding in public. Before that
we find another line of association, to do housework with a kitchen
cloth means a housewife, while the term housewife in the public
realm of the Internet means porn. Then we jump from Weininger's
definition of the female between (private) mother and (public)
prostitute to Wittgenstein and then quickly back to Weininger and
his definition of genius as resistance against the female. In
between there is a short consideration of the home of the
housewife, a building that would not be possible without an
architect. This short staccato somehow fails to make it clear
whether the private is developed as a public concept or the public
as a private concept. It only points out the impossibility of
separating them out.</p><p>The home and its interiors feature in the first part of the
book, but mainly it is about fear and its connection to the home,
its privacy and loneliness. The genius of Stark's text is again
this interweaving of a personal situation with reflections about
art, as, for instance, when installation art is defined in terms of
the relationship between inside and outside, or between the
architect and the housewife. There are certainly plenty of other
essays that deal with these spaces and their context as a central
motif for cultural analysis, but Frances Stark develops this
subject out of her own dialectic, allowing endless reversals if not
total oppositions to emerge. By locating the effect of literature
as an internal process, she allows it to unfold first in the
spirit. This spirit, bound by the limitation of our intellect and
perceptual possibilities, stands in contrast to the infinity of our
thoughts. One thing becomes clear in <em>The Architect & The
Housewife</em>, writing about public and private is in itself
thinking in a public space. This becomes apparent in the text
because there is no theoretical reference or consideration that is
not already imbedded in a private context. At one point Stark deals
with a text by Daniel Buren where he talks about the studio and
'the unspeakable compromise of the portable work of art'. Buren,
speaking as a modernist and, even more so, a minimalist, discusses
the impossibility of transporting an artwork into a 'neutral'
exhibition space when it is always united with a particular
location. In quoting this, Stark also contextualises it - a couple
having to enter into compromises in order to resolve differences.
This passage is then followed by a short paragraph about couples
leading up to the quote by Adolf Loos 'all art is erotic' and thus
returning again to architecture.</p><p>Throughout the whole essay, Stark discusses contradictions while
at the same time alternating between different levels of text that
to a greater or lesser extent respond to the contradictions
discussed while doing so in such a quick and seamless way that they
define and dissolve those opposites at the same time. Not
accidentally she quotes the film <em>Safe</em> by Todd Haynes in
which the protagonist develops an allergy against her whole
environment, though it is never exactly explained whether this was
due to external or internal causes. Long sections of the book are
also given over to the Californian artist Jorge Pardo, whose own
artistic practice, addresses the ambiguous space between
architectural design and artistic sculpture and who has recently
produced a whole house as a sculpture. This can be read as a
parallel to Frances Stark's texts. Spaces occupied by only one
position simply don't exist anymore. Just as architecture sometimes
ventures from the functional into the realm of the decorative, so
art can itself tread onto the territory of the functional.</p><p>Eventually the formalist divisions between modernisms and
postmodernisms break up to the point that their forms can change
meanings precisely according to the context out of which they
evolve. Art that quotes functionality appears modern, architecture
that uses decoration appears postmodern. In Frances Stark's
literature, the spaces of literary and scientific writing are drawn
together and yet come to mean the opposite of each other.</p><p class="author">— Martin Prinzhorn</p>
