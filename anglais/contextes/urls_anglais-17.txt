   corresponds to an out-of-date concept of marriage and has no
   justification from either the economic or the social standpoint. A
   housewife receives an income from her marriage and, if she actually
   does the housework, she improves the couple's standard of living. A
   number of working hypotheses are put forward in an attempt to see how
   the housewife could assume the normal responsibilities of a taxpayer
   and social security contributor.

   It is impossible (a) to assess the value of the services provided by
   the housewife in her sheltered environment and (b) even to know for
   certain what she really does there (many housewives employ charwomen or
   au pair girls or even full-time servants). However, when it is a

   this principle is valid with respect to benefits, it ought also to be
   valid with respect to obligations. Thus, the main proposal made here is
   that the housewife should pay income tax and social security

   correspondence between a housewife, on the one hand, and the cost of
   looking after children in the absence of the parents, on the other
   hand; it is based on the above-mentioned confusion arising from the
   attempt to justify the privileges granted to a housewife on the ground
   of the existence of children.
