How To Be A Good Housewife In The Modern Era

   Updated October 10, 2022 by ReGain Editorial Team

   The term housewife has come to have a negative connotation in the 21st
   century. The origin of housewife duty is actually a by-product of the
   Industrial Revolution when people moved out of agrarian societies and
   into modern cities and women faced new roles in society. With this new
   modern lifestyle, the definition of housewife came about: a woman who
   stays home and tends the children and house while her husband works in
   an industry-based job for forty or more hours a week. Whether they go
   by the name of housewife homemaker or stay-at-home mom, the housewife
   definition has certainly changed over the past century or so.

   Whether this is a result of less than accurate reality television, the
   prominence of feminism in current times, or some other idealization
   that being a housewife is no longer relevant, it is a job that has the
   opposite stigma than it did in the past. Women in the 1930s were
   expected to be housewives - the idea of women who work outside the home
   was frowned upon. They were expected to prioritize their home and
   family over everything else, especially a career. However, now that it
   is 2020, not only had the role of a housewife gone away nearly
   completely, but it has started to make a comeback.
