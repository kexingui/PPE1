   Most of us are so busy that we get up earlier and go to bed later to
   try to fit more hours in the day. Honestly, I haven’t been bored since
   1991! Anyone who believes a housewife’s life is boring should come and
   spend the day with one.

We are NOT looking down on women who work outside the home

   Being a housewife in the 21st century doesn’t mean that we think every
   woman should be one. Not every woman wants to be a housewife nor should
   they be. We know that there is no proof that children raised by stay at
   home moms are any happier or well adjusted than those raised by women

We are not all housewives ‘because we can afford to be’

   The decision to become a housewife or stay at home mom can have far
   reaching financial complications in the 21st century. Having only one
   income can mean having to tighten your belt and make sacrifices. It can

We are not ‘ladies of leisure’ or ‘ladies who lunch’

   If you see a housewife out to lunch with a friend, it’s likely been
   scheduled for weeks and we are sandwiching it in between other
   commitments. It’s not a regular occurrence and we’ve probably been

What is being a housewife in the 21st century – really?

   In a nutshell, being a housewife in the 21st century is a profession in

                 So refreshing to read as a newly housewife myself and I
                 love it! I was worried about others opinions now I am
                 fine!

       April, I love your article! I was able to be a housewife when we
       were raising our four children, if we needed some extra money I
       found things I could do out of the home to earn money. Now that our
       children are grown I still enjoy being a housewife! I find I never
       have enough time to do all the things I want to! Thanks for sharing
       your thoughts!

       saying the women who work are being sarcastic, please read this
       carefully:
       1. We hate it when our housewife friends say “its so good that your
       kitchen work is over by 9 am, I have to slog over the stove till 2
       in the afternoon”, after 9, we have to rush to the office to do

            women need to stick together and not criticise one another –
            and twisted it the way that you have. It sounds to me as if
            some of your “housewife friends” have not been as supportive
            as I would be and that makes me sad too. And I must stress
            again that I am not and never will be a “lady who lunches” –

                 It is also, in part because we belong to two very diverse
                 regions, India, is not a very conducive place to have a
                 career. But being a housewife is way easier since help is
                 cheap here. So maybe I was bringing my regional
                 experience, which you obviously would not be able to

       Hi again April! Lately, I’ve been getting all sorts of comments
       from nosy people, asking me where I work, what I do. Then when I
       say I’m a housewife they spill all sorts of negative comments ad
       judgment. I am married to my husband, not them! Do you ever get
       those? If so, how do you react? I need some help!

            at comments you may have had here but “I’m far too busy (or I
            simply don’t have time) to be bored / lazy / unfulfilled” has
            worked well for me in the past as has “Me being a housewife
            works extremely well for my husband and I.” If they have been
            very rude I would add “Your assessment of the situation is

                 Thanks, it helps! I’ve been called “just a 50’s housewife
                 waiting for her husband to come home”, which isn’t true,
                 and just in general, many women just stare at me and say

            I’m so glad this post resonated with you, Yasmin. I hope that
            all your dreams of home and family will come true and that you
            enjoy being a housewife as much as I have 🙂

            Thank you so much, Carmela, and a special thank you for
            sharing as well! Thank you also for teaching me the Italian
            word for housewife 🙂 I love languages, although I have yet to
            learn Italian! xx

       what do you do for a living?” The assumption that I am stupid or
       uninteresting is so galling. Anyways, thank you so much for summing
       up what being a housewife in the 21st century is like.

       4. As a guy, I wish I would have found a woman who sees the
       possibilities for stay-at-home-housewife like I do. Unfortunately,
       they all ended up wanting to compete-like-men-outside-the-home….

       I needed to read this today. Wondering if you still are a housewife

            I’m so glad it resonated with you, Trudy. Yes, I am still a
            housewife in 2020! I’ve been a housewife for nearly 30 years
            now 🙂 I did do some part time work in the early part of that
            time, and of course I have the blog and other projects, but
            I’ve always considered myself a housewife first. I think a lot
            of housewives have projects and businesses now too 🙂 It’s
            wonderful to have so many choices!

       Beautiful I don’t want repeat every word that you said. I agree not
       because I am a Housewife, I agree because I was a single woman
       before, and now this experience has been the best rewarding and
       knowledgeable experience I ever have. Is not just about the

            have gone from a situation where women who dared to work
            outside the home were criticised, to being criticised for
            deciding to become (and/or remain) a housewife. Whatever your
            decision or however you choose to describe what you decide to
            do, know that you are valued and important, and that you are

       But major concern of mine is I hope the husband does not make one
       feel inferior about this choice
       Cause I genuinely feel being a housewife is not a bad thing at all

       I just stumbled upon your post after deciding to fully embrace
       being a housewife/future sahm. After an early career in Corporate
       America and recently finishing graduate school, I realized that the
       most important thing to me is family, nurturing my home space, and

       questions I had. I’m a teacher and over the years have realized my
       purpose in my life is to nurture. The second part of my life maybe
       leading to becoming a housewife. Do you have a instagram or
       Facebook page and or a podcast? I’m looking for to reading your
       past articles and future readings!

       agreed. almost all throughout my 20s I never even bothered
       attempting to assert myself as wanting to be a housewife, because
       it seemed at this point that all women are expected to work as much
       as a man. I was afraid of looking like a golddigger. but eventually

       so glad that despite women’s lib hypocrisy, I finally can make up
       for my own losses, and stay home to raise my own kids one day. in
       the meantime it’s really awesome to finally see that housewifery
       isn’t dead unless I want it to be.

            do the same thing. It’s so important we are able to choose to
            do what works for us and for our families, whether that’s to
            be a housewife, have a career or any combination of the two.
            I’m glad being a housewife works for you, as it has for me.
            I’m so pleased the article resonated with you. Thank you again
            for commenting!

       Well spoken. Love your choice of words, Brilliant in so many ways.
       I’m 24, pregnant with my second child, the firstborn is 3. Though
       the idea of being a housewife/homemaker/stay-at-home mom was never
       even something that crossed my mind before I got pregnant with my
       first child, it’s now something I enjoy and value so much,

       Wow, I love this perspective on both housewife/mom and working
       wife/mom. I don’t like the term housewife and prefer CEO of

       this article. I particularly love the part where you say it’s a
