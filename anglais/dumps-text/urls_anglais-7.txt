The Many Lives of the Angry Housewife

   The housewife novel is having a comeback, continuing the tradition of
   exploring domesticity and self-hood in fiction.

   The housewife novel is having a comeback. Writing for Slate, Laura
   Miller called the housewife “both the muse and the patron of the
   novel,” noting Jill Alexander Essbaum’s contemporary novel Hausfrau
   (longlisted for the 2016 PEN Literary Awards) and Helen Ellis’s new
   short story collection American Housewife.

   Both writers consider the isolation of the housewife and how it can
   lead to dark places. One of Ellis’s women claims, “When my husband’s at
   work I don’t get lonely. I have plenty to do. There’s the dusting.” The
   narrator of “What I Do All Day” describes her household duties with
   unsettling violence: “I shred cheese. I berate a pickle jar. I pump the
   salad spinner like a CPR dummy. I strangle defrosted spinach.” Beneath
   each monotonous chore simmers the fury of someone who suspects she is
   wasting her life.

   Hausfrau’s anesthetized Anna attempts to spark herself back to life
   through a series of risky sexual entanglements. “A lonely woman is a
   dangerous woman,” Essbaum writes. “A lonely woman is a bored woman.
   Bored women act on impulse.” Anna is indeed lonely, bored, and
   dangerous. Tellingly, she focuses on home only when teetering at the
   edge of the abyss—a meditation on how her mother used to sew signals
   that a breakdown was imminent.

   Is unhappy housewife fiction the literary fallout of the Mommy Wars? As
   women who don’t stay home are made to feel guilty and are often put
   into one impossible situation after another, the women who do stay home
   face a whole other psychological minefield. The housewife has long
   struggled to feel relevant and valued; back in 1928, Ruth Steele Brooks
   wrote, “Because our compensation is in kind rather than in cash, we
   tend to undervalue both it and the labor involved.”

   But is the housewife really necessarily bored, lonely, powerless, and
   on the brink of despair? During the Depression, the figure of the
   modest, self-sacrificing homemaker was glorified in visual art and in
   the written word. In reality, as Annelise Orleck writes in “’We Are
   That Mythical Thing Called the Public’: Militant Housewives during the
   Great Depression,” throughout the 1930s and 1940s many housewives
   organized, agitating for change like lower food prices and more
   affordable housing. Across the country, women’s protests were covered
   by the national media, supported by unions, and ultimately affected
   real political change.

   It’s possible that these fed-up working-class housewives knew something
   that the languid stay-at-home mothers in today’s fiction are still
   struggling to learn: that housework is not going to keep any thinking
   person’s mind engaged for long, and that one frequently yearns to feel
   that one has some power in the outside world. Which is not to say that
   the establishment was happy with “militant housewives.” Orleck notes
   that the disgruntled husband was a common trope, but that far from
   dismantling their family units by pursuing outside interests, “wives
   and mothers left their homes in order to preserve them.”

   Or, as Essbaum puts it, “It is possible to lead several lives at once.
   In fact, it is impossible not to.”
