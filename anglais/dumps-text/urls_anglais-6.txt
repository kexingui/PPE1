I Am Not “Just” A Housewife

   Every so often an article or tweet will say out loud what I have been
   fearing in the depths of my being. I’m “just” a homemaker. I can see
   the expression I often get when I answer that dreaded question. “What
   do you do?” Then, I get the follow-up. “Oh, so what do you do?” The
   questioner might get a list of my daily tasks, or they might get a
   blank stare because I kind of can’t think of anything I do. The
   self-doubt that can accompany the American homemaker is crushing but
   also completely unfounded. And every so often someone will write an
   article or tweet that is so ignorant and tone-deaf I remember how
   significant my job is. Case in point…

The Advice Column

   Earlier this month, March 2021, Slate gave a response to a man looking
   for advice about his wife. She was a hardworking career woman, and he
   found that attractive. I don’t think I’m overstepping when I say that
   it appears he respected her, in part, due to her work performance.
   Well, she recently up and flipped the script on him.

   This man’s wife gave birth to their first child about a year ago, and
   she’s due to get back to work soon. But she has betrayed the plan they
   had made and told him she wants to stay home and raise their child. The
   husband’s letter to Slate is almost comical and 100% disappointing. In
   his letter he was dismayed and concerned about seeing her “give up.” He
   went as far as to suggest his wife would set a bad example for their
   child if she chose to become a stay-at-home mom.

   His question ended on a low note. He said he asked his wife if this
   desire to stay home was a result of mental health struggles. He
   ultimately admitted to Slate that he does not “like or admire” this
   side of her. All in all, he’s a real peach…

The Feminist Response

   The response from Slate was surprisingly balanced and supportive of the
   wife’s potential departure from her job, but another response ensured
   that radical feminism had its voice heard. Jill Filipovic, feminist,
   posted a series of tweets in response to this man’s question. Here are
   some of her explicit and implicit points.

1. Quitting a job is not a decision just one partner in a marriage should
make.

   I actually agree. That’s a huge decision, especially if it means
   leaving the workforce altogether.

2. A housewife is completely dependent on her husband.

   I see where she’s coming from. I make ZERO dollars for my family, and,
   in fact, depend on my husband to provide for us. But am I completely
   dependent on him? Filipovic, and many others, only see homemaking
   through the lens of income, but this is too simplistic.

   My husband would be the first to tell you that my work around the house
   and with our children has value. I’m not sitting on the couch
   surrounded by a dirty house and unkempt kids while I stream Netflix and
   eat chips all day. (Junk food and binge watching sounds fun, though…)
   My husband usually comes home to a clean house, educated kids (we
   homeschool), a stocked pantry and fridge, and home-cooked meals. I also
   handle the budget, take care of the taxes, plan our trips, keep laundry
   mostly-ish up-to-date, and ensure all our needs are being addressed. I
   run this ship despite the fact that I don’t fund it.

   What am I saying? My point is that my husband depends on me, too.
   Without my contributions to our family, he would struggle to keep
   things going. I need him, and he needs me. We have chosen to live this
   way because we are married. We are “one flesh” (Genesis 2:24, Ephesians
   5:31). I am his “help meet” (Genesis 2:18). We are a partnership that
   works together to serve Christ and each other. He is not bitter that he
   has to work, and I do not resent staying home. We each have our role to
   play, and plenty of families choose this model.

3. A housewife is not ambitious.

   This can be true. Also, an employed person can be unambitious. I take
   issue with Filipovic’s implication that to be a stay-at-home mom is to
   inherently lack ambition. Has she, like, met kids? Has she had the
   daily temptation of knowing that no one will hold her accountable to
   her day’s productivity?

   Unambitious people like me have to run our own schedules. I don’t have
   outward forces giving me deadlines, dress codes, and tasks to complete
   by day’s end. I also do not have the tangible short-term reward of a
   paycheck or recognition. I’ve yet to receive applause for completing
   laundry for a family of seven, and no one has ever thanked me for a
   week’s worth of meals with a bonus check or my picture on the wall and
   a special parking spot for the month.

   Losers like me are playing the long game. I have to motivate myself
   each and every day to pour my efforts, talents, and skills into a
   thankless job that other people call unambitious and lazy because I see
   the intrinsic value in what I offer my home. I am thankful to have a
   husband and social circle who see the value of housewives, too.
   Clearly, as demonstrated in that Slate question and Filipovic’s twitter
   rant, not everyone understands the meaningful and valuable work that
   goes into homemaking.

4. Housewives set a bad example to their children.

   Children who see a woman sacrifice personal gain (e.g., money, praise)
   to provide for the needs of the family are witnessing love, duty, and
   selflessness. These are not necessarily traits I would want to hide
   from kids. Dads providing financially for their families also set a
   wonderful example of responsibility, duty, love, sacrifice, and
   manhood. (Yup. I said it. Men should be providers.)

   Filipovic implies an imbalance because of men working for pay and
   housewives not earning a wage. Well, the man in this scenario has a
   job. Thus, he is paid. The housewife, although working, does not have a
   job. So, she would not get paid. These are the understood and agreed
   upon conditions of this family set-up. If there is any sort of
   complaint to make about the imbalance in these lifestyles, people like
   Filipovic are to blame. Tangents about women’s place being at work and
   the inherent lack of value of caring for a family are the problem.
   People like her perpetuate the lies that mothers are not needed at
   home, women have to earn a wage to have worth, and kids are just as
   well off if the daycare raises them while mom works 50 hours a week.

5. Housewives’ identities are wrapped up in their children, and it’s pretty
self-focused.

   Speaking for myself, I can be really self-focused. I blame it on being
   an only child and a latchkey kid. And on being human. My decision to be
   home with my kids, however, is the least self-focused thing I have ever
   done. Again, has Filipovic even met a kid?! Very little of my
   day-to-day life is about me.

   My identity is as a child of God. In fact, thanks to my salvation
   through Jesus, I’m a co-heir with Christ (Romans 8:17). I’m also a
   wife. Outside of my relationship with Jesus, my marriage is my primary
   relationship. Then, yes, I’m a mother, and my children mean the world
   to me, but I’m more than that. I’m a church member, friend, daughter,
   counselor, encourager, etc. As a Christian, my focus is not on self, or
   at least I aim for it not to be. My choice to stay home is not to focus
   inward but, rather, to invest myself as fully as I can into my children
   and guide them into adulthood.

   Christians aren’t the only ones putting focus on others, though.
   Secular housewives I’ve known feel guilty when they engage in
   self-care. So, they often neglect their own needs. (Note: Please don’t
   do that. Don’t be that martyr mother. It isn’t good for anyone.) These
   ladies volunteer at school activities, help sick/elderly relatives,
   assist their husbands with work, emotionally support their friends, and
   any number of other tasks on a daily basis. I would submit that these
   women are more likely to feel unsupported, uncared for, and overwhelmed
   than to be selfishly pursuing themselves through child-rearing.

Final Thought

   Women have hard choices to make. We were sold a bill of goods and told
   we could have it all. Not just that, we were told we deserve it all. In
   truth, we can’t have the big-time career, perfect family, best
   marriage, and biggest house in the nicest neighborhood. Sacrifices must
   be made. Some women, like me, choose to let go of the career. Others
   choose not to be mothers. Most, I believe, choose the middle ground.
   They do the absolute best they can with the limited time they have.

   I have days that challenge me and leave me filled with self-doubt. “I
   have a master’s degree, and all I do are mundane tasks.” “No one sees
   me.” “Am I boring?” “Am I a leech?” “Am I a disappointment?” That
   self-talk is hurtful, unhelpful, and based on the expectations of a
   world that no longer values traditional womanhood. Titus 2 says we
   ought to love our husbands, love our children, and be keepers of the
   home (v.4-5). The Lord sees what I put my time and energy into, and I
   know that He is pleased. So, I can be pleased, as well, knowing I am
   living in obedience to Him.

   Christian ladies, have no shame in the choice to be a housewife. The
   world’s ways are not our ways. Pray for women like Filipovic who hate
   traditional womanhood so much that they would suggest it is harmful.
   Pray for men like the man who wrote Slate. They need to soften their
   hearts toward their wives and children. Pray for women who are making
   decisions about their families in a world that hates God and His ways.

Afterthought (because people assume the worst)

   Although I despise the need to write this, I assume it must be done
   because of the sensitive nature of the topic. I am not judging and
   condemning women who work. Instead, I m choosing to affirm housewives
   in light of the Slate article and Filipovic’s response to it. Each
   family needs to prayerfully make its own decisions about how to best
   serve God and raise children.

       I know I haven’t commented about your blogs, but know I hear you
       and have the same struggles (and am only homeschooling Maya; Pray
       hard for Aleena, that she comes back to God, repents and turns away
       from the humanist theology of public school) and so reading these
       posts have been such a lighthouse for me. I come back to Gods word
       absolutely first and my husband, but from one full time
       mom/homeschooling home to another your story helps me stay on
       track!
       I love you very much and miss you all terribly!

            Christian women need each other as we make our way through
            life. So many voices pull us away from truth, and I pray that
            my insignificant, small voice reminds other Christian women
            that they are not alone. And there is so much to thank God
            for! I’m so happy to hear that other women are feeling and
            experiencing similar things…understanding what I’m saying.
            It’s extra special when it’s someone like you! 🙂
