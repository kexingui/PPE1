Advantages and Disadvantages of Being a Housewife

   The advantages and disadvantages of being a housewife are described
   here in this article. Before coming to the advantages and disadvantages
   let us know in detail what housewife means.  A woman who stays at home
   to take care of her home and family is known as housewife. Everyone has
   their unique ideas related to this topic as for someone being housewife
   is a cakewalk and for some other it is difficult to be a housewife. As
   a coin as both sides like that being a housewife has its own advantages
   and disadvantages. Let us get into detail.

Advantages of being a housewife

   The advantages of being a housewife are described below in detail:

1. Keeping an eye on children and taking care of home

   If both the partners are busy in their professional lives there is no
   scope to take care of their home and children as there is any time for
   them. One has to be very responsible and should take care of one’s
   children. Due to this they have to depend on other people to take care
   of their kids and home and they cannot keep an eye on what is happening
   in the home. Being a housewife she can closely watch and monitor her
   kids this will increase bonding between the kids and her. Thus she can
   completely enjoy her motherhood by watching her kids growing which is
   not possible for a working woman. As she is a home keeper she will
   maintain their home neat and hygiene. There is no wastage of money also
   as there is no need to hire a maid.

2. Flexibility

   Housewife has a flexibility to do daily household chores or anything
   else as she wishes to do. There is no particular order in doing her
   works. As there are no deadlines or stress in doing work like job
   holders she has mental peace in doing her work. As she is not
   answerable to any one on what to do or how to do she does whatever she
   likes to do in her own way.

   Being a housewife one can utilize their time wisely and use their
   leisure time for increasing her skills. Although she is doing
   everyone’s work in the house she can manage to have her own time which
   is lack in some working women’s.  In leisure time she can do work from
   home jobs, learn new things, explore her interests, and do her favorite
   things etc.., all these cannot be possible to do for a working woman as
   she has no time to come up with her interests. And while we compare
   housewife and working woman housewife work for almost 5-6 hours a day
   whereas working woman has to work for 8-10 hours depending on their job
   nature by this we can say that housewife feel less tired than a working
   woman.

4. Housewife is herself a Boss and maid too

   rearrange things in her home she can do according to her taste as she

   the sacrifice she was doing to the family. Being a housewife is plays
   both the roles of a boss and a maid which give her satisfaction.

   some people to have a partner who is housewife. In her point of view

   can take care her skin, hair etc., as she has time to maintain but it
   is not possible to maintain everything careful for a working women like

   know anything about such matters. She is treated as an orthodox or
   superstitious person.

   to give gifts to her loved ones or for herself she has to again ask
   money which she feels bad and insecure. And if family is facing some
   serious financial issues housewife cannot able to help them.
