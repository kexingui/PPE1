The Housewife Theory of History

   Rebecca Solnit

   ON THE WEST COAST OF MADAGASCAR, there’s a tribe called the Sakalava,
   who are theoretically monarchists, loyal to a line of male kings. Their
   loyalty, however, is to dead rather than living kings, and the wishes
   of the dead kings are made known through spirit mediums who are,
   according to David Graeber in his wonderful Fragments of an Anarchist
   Anthropology, “usually elderly women of common descent.” Which is to
   say that, officially, the Sakalava are governed by elite men, but
   ordinary elderly women are the literal voices of authority.

   I’m not sure we’re much different. We are governed mostly by elite men,
   quite a lot of them seemingly dead, and everything in our culture
   encourages us to regard these rulers not just as the central but the
   sole source of power. But history is changed again and again by people
   who are supposedly powerless, including the women veiled by the
   dismissive moniker housewife.

   When Kristen Breitweiser, Patty Casazza, Lorie Van Auken, and Mindy
   Kleinberg, widows of men killed in the attacks on the World Trade
   Center, started doing research and demanding answers from elected
   representatives, they gave rise to the 9/11 Commission. Nicknamed the
   Jersey Girls, they became experts on national security and terrorism. A
   year after the towers collapsed, one of them spoke forcefully to
   Congress about what had really happened. A year and a half after that,
   the 9/11 Commission issued the official verdict that there were no ties
   between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda. By that time, the Jersey Girls
   were campaigning against Bush’s re-election.

   They didn’t win that one, but they won’t go away, any more than the
   Seattle-area mothers of mentally disabled children did when they ran
   into roadblock after roadblock to getting their children public school
   educations and other basic rights. Those three mothers, Evelyn Chapman,
   Katie Dolan, and Jane Taggart, went, as my friend Susan Schwartzenberg
   says in her forthcoming book, Becoming Citizens: Family Life and the
   Politics of Disability, “from outraged mothers to sophisticated
   activists utilizing a well-honed network of politicians, labor leaders,
   legislators, judges and the media.” In 1971, Washington State passed
   the law that paved the way for the national Education for All Act of
   1975, renamed the IDEA — Individuals with Disabilities Education Act —
   in 1990.

   I think of Lois Gibbs in Love Canal in upstate New York, who started
   investigating the rash of illnesses in her working-class neighborhood,
   founded the Love Canal Homeowners Association in 1978, and continued
   connecting the dots and fighting the power until she became a founding
   figure in the environmental justice movement. Today she is director of
   the Center for Health, Environment, and Justice, helping people find
   the voice to oppose their own destruction and fighting to reduce human
   exposure to poisons like dioxin. Her work helped generate the
   Environmental Protection Agency. I think of Las Madres de Este Los
   Angeles, who succeeded in keeping a succession of toxic dumps,
   incinerators, and a chemical treatment plant out of their East L.A.
   neighborhood in the 1980s and 1990s.

   I think of Women Strike for Peace, who faced down anticommunist
   authorities at the height of the Cold War to protest the nuclear arms
   race, nuclear weapons, and the nuclear testing that was causing
   catastrophic damage to the environment and human health — particularly
   that of infants and children. They started in November of 1961 with a
   one-day strike in the mode of Lysistrata, more than a hundred thousand
   of them in cities across the country leaving their homes to stand up
   against arms and war. The members of WSP subversively used their gender
   and their genteel, housewifely image to suggest that being against what
   the government was doing wasn’t radical but sensible, motherly, and
   kindhearted.

   This might be the secret of the housewife theory of history: These
   women take the qualities that are supposed to render them irrelevant
   and use them defiantly as well as strategically. Starting with what
   they love, they cut straight through the quicksand of motives and
   purposes to point out that harm has been done and should be stopped. In
   some sense, they depoliticize politics, which is what makes them so
   politically potent. When asked whether they were in cahoots with the
   Soviets, WSP activists said that they thought perhaps Soviet mothers
   didn’t want their children afflicted by fallout either.

   Women Strike for Peace achieved two signal victories. One was their
   contribution to the end of aboveground nuclear testing with the Limited
   Test Ban Treaty of 1963, a huge step forward in limiting the arms race
   and its environmental damage. The other was the decline and fall of the
   House Un-American Activities Committee, the Homeland Security Grand
   Inquisition of its day. When interrogated, the WSP women on trial so
   mocked and exposed the heavy-handed fearmongering of the HUAC that they
   helped to destroy it, making possible far freer political expression.
   They opposed the Vietnam War early on. And so the 60s, that era often
   associated with young men, was jump-started by women who used hats and
   gloves and baby carriages as part of their arsenal.

   You could go farther afield to Buenos Aires, where the Mothers of the
   Plaza de Mayo became the most fearless and visible opposition to a
   terrifying regime by organizing women across Argentina and contacting
   international human rights organizations. They still walk in protest in
   the Plaza de Mayo, the center of the nation, every week. They used
   their status as mothers to reject the definitions the government
   offered for those who had been “disappeared”: These were not
   terrorists, they were beloved children who could not be erased. You
   could look to the women of the Niger Delta, who since 1986 have
   repeatedly shut down Shell and Chevron’s oil facilities. But even here
   at home the history is clear: the 9/11 Commission, the EPA, the Limited
   Test Ban Treaty, the Education for All Act. That’s a radically
   different landscape than we might have occupied had these activists not
   stood up for themselves and their clan.

   The typical cinematic consequence of personal injury is the outraged
   paterfamilias avenging his family with a gun, a role played by Charles
   Bronson, Bruce Willis, Clint Eastwood, and George Bush. These killers
   don’t pursue principles or seek to prevent further harm; instead they
   inflict it in revenge. Silkwood and Erin Brockovich are anomalies. They
   illustrate how the housewife-become-activist shifts from defending her
   own tribe to defending the principle that everyone should be free from
   fallout or dioxin, that everyone should have an education or know the
   truth about what the government is doing. She fights not for revenge,
   but for rights. The community she develops generates organizations,
   legislation, laws, education, and awareness. It’s a saga of expanding
   connections, while the killer heroes in the movies remain strikingly
   isolated. One of the problems for unions and organizers in America is
   that our dominant stories about how the world gets changed feature lone
   heroes, not collectives and associations. The unsung builders of those
   associations make a shift from the personal and local to the national
   and the principle, which becomes the only way to continue taking care.

   The Greek word oikos, meaning house, is the root of the word ecologist,
   which could be defined as, among other things, housewife. It’s not that
   I’m so fixated on housewives, who are one among many categories of
   individual that have taken power to change the world, and it’s not that
   I believe that the category housewife is so compelling a definition of
   women who have other lives before and after and often during staying
   home with kids. It’s that, just as the Sakalava are officially ruled by
   kings while elderly commoner women do the talking, so are we officially
   rescued by action-hero loners while others do the real work of
   organizing to save the world (from, among other things, action-hero
   loners).

   Rebecca Solnit’s father was a pretty good urban planner, but it was her
   mother who did volunteer work for fair-housing rights during the Civil
   Rights era. Solnit’s latest book is A Field Guide to Getting Lost.
