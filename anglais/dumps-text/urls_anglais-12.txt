‘I feel like a 1950s housewife’: how lockdown has exposed the gender divide

   It’s still expected that women will make their jobs fit around
   childcare and home schooling, while a man’s job comes first

   During the lockdown, Anna Bosworth, a freelance marketing consultant,
   has given up on her career so that her husband can concentrate on his.
   “There isn’t a second I can work, from 5am until my kids go to sleep at
   8.30pm,” she says. “I can’t do anything productive.”

   Like many working mothers, Bosworth is self-employed and went part-time
   after she had her first child. Meanwhile, her husband has a full-time
   job at an advertising agency. He is continuing to work normally, except
   for one day a week which he is taking as holiday. “He’s doing
   everything to help with the children, but I feel lucky he still has a
   job,” says Bosworth. “The priority for us is to keep our house and pay
   our bills, and his job is the most straightforward route to that.”

   They have an eight-month-old baby and a five-year-old girl, and
   normally get help from grandparents and a childminder so that they can
   both work. “I’m a feminist and believe in choice,” she says. “But
   because of the pandemic, my choices have been taken away. I feel like a
   1950s housewife.”

   She is not alone. During the lockdown, mothers in the UK are typically
   providing at least 50% more childcare as well as spending around 10% to
   30% more time than fathers home schooling their children, figures
   analysed by the Observer show.

   It doesn’t matter whether a woman is working from home, working outside
   the home or not working at all: the research reveals she is typically
   spending at least an extra hour-and-a-half on childcare and home
   schooling every day, compared to the average man in the same
   circumstances.

   The research, carried out by economists from the universities of
   Cambridge, Oxford and Zurich between 9 and 14 April, indicates that a
   woman who is at home – whether or not she is formally working – is
   affected by this gender divide. Both employed and unemployed mothers
   are typically spending around six hours providing childcare and home
   schooling every working day. By contrast, the average father at home is
   only spending a little over four hours on childcare and homeschooling
   each working day, regardless of his employment status.

   “Whatever situation you have, on average it’s the woman doing more, and
   it’s not because she’s working less” says Dr Christopher Rauh, an
   economist at Cambridge University.

     Men seem to be able to lock themselves away in a study, while women
     are working at the kitchen table – and also trying to home educate

   Mary-Ann Stephenson, Women's Budget Group

   The gender divide is even larger in high-income households. A mother
   who earns over £80,000 and is working from home is typically doing 3.3
   hours of home schooling and 3.8 hours of childcare each day – over
   seven hours in total. A typical father who earns over £80,000 only
   spends 2.1 hours home schooling his children and 2.3 hours on childcare
   each working day – less than 4.5 hours in total.

   “The higher the household income, the more time women are spending home
   schooling compared to men,” says Rauh. “People come up with
   explanations – like women are better at taking care of their children
   due to evolution – but if that were true, it shouldn’t apply to home
   schooling. Yet we also see those differences here.”

   The amount of home schooling children are receiving in lockdown appears
   to be particularly affected by the income of their mothers, with the
   lowest-paid women spending 2.1 hours a day educating their children
   each day (over an hour less than the highest-paid women). Fathers
   earning £0 to £20,000 are doing even less homeschooling (1.9 hours),
   but that’s still roughly the same as the higher-paid men.

   The starkest gender divide among low-paid parents, however, is around
   childcare. Like the highest-paid women, those women earning £0 to
   £20,000 are doing 3.9 hours of childcare each day. By contrast, the
   lowest-paid men are carrying out just 2.4 hours of childcare each day.

   In other words, a woman earning over £80,000 and working from home is
   typically spending 60% more time (an extra 1.4 hours) on childcare each
   working day than the average man earning £0 to £20,000.

   Mary-Ann Stephenson, director of the Women’s Budget Group, thinks this
   may be because women are more used to having to juggle looking after
   children and work than men. “It may be that in an emergency the woman
   takes on more of the childcare work,” she says.

   Children may also be more inclined to go to their mothers than their
   fathers, she says. Similarly, if their father is paid more, it might be
   seen as more important that he doesn’t lose his job.

   The home-learning platform Atom Learning says that since the lockdown
   began, more than three-quarters of parents who have registered their
   children for free online lessons and set them schoolwork were female.

   At the same time, there is evidence that women’s contributions outside
   the home are decreasing. There has been a drop in the number of
   solo-authored academic papers submitted by women, while submissions by
   male academics have increased. Similarly, at the Philosophy Foundation,
   the majority of the organisation’s work is now being carried out by
   men. “This is because most of our female philosophers are having to
   focus on childcare and home education” says co-CEO Emma Worley.

   Working Families, which runs a legal advice service for parents and
   carers, has seen a sixfold increase in inquiries since the lockdown
   began, 80% of which have come from women. “We have seen evidence from
   mothers that they’re being penalised and not being supported to work
   from home because they have children. We’ve also seen mothers having to
   take unpaid leave or being dismissed.”

   There are concerns about the impact of all this on women’s mental
   health. Research from King’s College London shows that, since the
   lockdown began, 57% of women say they are feeling more anxious and
   depressed, compared to only 40% of men. More women than men also report
   that they are getting less sleep, and eating less healthily, than
   usual.

   “In a large number of cases, women are doing the vast majority of the
   caring for small children and the home educating work,” says
   Stephenson. “The men seem to be able to lock themselves away in a
   study, while the women are working at the kitchen table – and also
   trying to home-educate”

   Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, says the wider
   implications of the lockdown gender divide are clear. “This shows that
   the default assumptions about who does the caring for children
   fundamentally haven’t shifted. It defaults to women. There’s still an
   expectation that women will make their jobs fit around the caring,
   whereas a man’s job will come first.”

‘You don’t feel like you’re performing 100%’

   Lizzie Harrop and her son, Barnaby, aged 5.
   Lizzie Harrop and her son, Barnaby, aged 5.

   In lockdown, Lizzie Harrop had been experiencing the same anxiety
   levels she felt when she was suffering from postnatal depression five
   years ago. “In the beginning, my child was making me feel like a
   prisoner again. I was trapped in my own home, with responsibility for a
   five-year-old and a huge pressure to teach him, but I had a job to do
   as well.”

   She works full-time in a senior role at a well-known company – and for
   the first week was having to conduct almost every single meeting with
   her son, Barnaby, on her knee. “I called him my shadow. He was very
   excited about having me around all the time. But it was relentless,
   seven days a week.”

   Her stress levels rose. “Even though the business was being brilliant
   around not expecting parents with children at home to do all their
   usual hours, as a hardworking person you don’t feel like you’re
   performing 100%. As a consequence, you feel like you’re failing. And
   failing is just a shit place to be.”

   She and her husband both work full-time and earn equal salaries. “But
   if I am at home, my child will always migrate to me –and that’s a
   bloody nightmare.”

   She began to argue with her husband about whose job was more important,
   resulting in some major rows. “There were moments when we were like:
   we’re probably not going to make it through this lockdown together. We
   had a couple of really difficult conversations.”

   But now, she says, they are in “a really good place”. The key change
   was deciding to “own” her situation in lockdown. “You’ve got to boss
   it. You can’t let it boss you.”

   That’s where the framework came in: a shared calendar that shows who is
   the primary carer for their son every minute of the day from 6am until
   bedtime, with each parent expected to do equal amounts of childcare and
   home schooling during that period, ideally in scheduled three-hour
   chunks. The timing of work meetings – and exercise – must be diarised
   and agreed between them, days in advance.

   “What I’ve now observed is that my husband is brilliant with Barnaby,
   who has turned into a different, more confident boy with both of us
   being there for him at home. And as a couple, we’ve gotten much closer
   together. I think we had to have a rocky bit to come out the other
   side.”
