Whatever happened to the housewife?

   It started 40 years ago, when a letter to this paper led to a register
   of all those bored women stuck at home in suburbia. And now?

   It was with sharp frustration and a dollop of sympathy that Guardian
   journalist Betty Jerman wrote about surburbia 40 years ago. The open
   space and fresh air, she said, made it a good place to bring up
   children, but she feared these advantages were outweighed by the
   brain-numbing atmosphere.

   "Surburbia is an incredibly dull place to live in and I blame the
   women," she wrote. "They stay here all day. They set the tone. Many of
   them look back with regret to the days when they worked in an office.
   Their work kept them alert. Home and childminding can have a blunting
   effect on a woman's mind. But only she can sharpen it."

   Jerman's observations struck a chord with reader Maureen Nicol. She
   wrote to the paper suggesting that "housebound wives with liberal
   interests and a desire to remain individuals could form a national
   register, so that whenever one moves, one can contact like-minded
   friends".

   An avalanche of letters was sent to the paper from desperate women all
   over the country who felt they were floundering in what society
   expected of them as wives and mothers. Women who had been educated but,
   like their mothers before them, found themselves trapped in the
   domestic sphere, often having to up sticks because of their husband's
   job, even if they'd found a kindred spirit nearby.

   Local groups formed and a few years later acquired the name the
   National Housewives' Register. In the absence of a personal income,
   early members admit fiddling the housekeeping to raise the small
   membership fee. Today most groups meet every other week to discuss
   everything except the domestic, with debates on current affairs, book
   groups and speakers invited from every public sphere.

   Year on year membership grew until, in 1980, it peaked at 24,000. This
   enthusiasm proved Virginia Woolf right when, in A Room Of One's Own,
   she wrote: "Women have sat indoors all these millions of years, so that
   by this time the very walls are permeated by their creative force,
   which has, indeed, so overcharged the capacity of bricks and mortar
   that it must needs harness itself to pens and brushes and business and
   politics." Numbers have been falling since the 80s; today 8,000 women
   are members of what has been known since 1987 as the National Women's
   Register.

   The change of title raises the question of the organisation's future.
   The oldest member is 92 and though there are members in their late 20s,
   this generation of women is by no means rushing to join. NWR may be
   celebrating its ruby anniversary but will an organisation born to
   alleviate the lot of the housewife survive to drink to its golden when,
   politically and personally, she is apparently dead and buried? Imagine
   the outcry if Tony Blair made an example of the housewife's foresight
   in the way Margaret Thatcher once did. The title has been banished to
   the social history archives and now rears its head only in the
   unreconstructed genres of TV quiz shows and market research
   questionnaires.

   The spic 'n' span 50s feather duster image of the British housewife
   went out with Hilda Ogden and Ken Dodd. Instead, the debate about women
   and domesticity has evolved into an anxiety not about keeping house but
   about bringing up children. So whereas it was better for "him" for a
   woman to stay at home, the argument now is it's best for the kids. The
   observation Jerman made about the mental "pay-off' a housewife makes
   still has echoes. What's best for the children may not be what's best
   for the modern woman. The lack of status implied by the prefix "just" a
   housewife has not died with the term but now attaches itself to the
   word mother.

   "Working mother" now rolls off the tongue with the ease with which
   "housewife" once did. These women no longer go into voluntary exile if
   they marry or have children but, argues Mary Dodkins, NWR's marketing
   co-ordinator, there is still a need for a space where you are not
   someone's wife or mother, a place where you can be opinionated without
   fear of the consequences. Today, most members work, so the rules have
   been extended - no discussion about the domestic still stands but their
   jobs are now an out-of-bounds subject.

   "The purpose of the meetings is still to stimulate the grey cells,"
   Dodkins says. "Many women feel limited by their job and position. It is
   not a place where they feel their real thoughts can be said, so the
   more controversial the discussions are, the better."

   For Kathryn de Motte, at 37 the youngest area organiser of a 30-strong
   NWR group in Nottingham, the emphasis on speaking your mind is crucial.
   She works as a secretary and finds herself having opinions she says she
   wouldn't articulate anywhere else."We all have different hats," she
   explains. "I'm a mother, I'm a wife and I work, and there's never a
   space to be me. We get together not to exercise or diet but to open our
   minds."

   De Motte speaks enthusiastically about the subjects to which the
   speakers and discussions have introduced her: badgers, local history
   and learning how to juggle at the lighter end; Kafka, fox-hunting and
   infant mortality rates at the more serious.

   But as women juggle the domestic with work, is there a need for the
   NWR? "It's still important to be with like-minded women," de Motte
   says. "Women still have more pressures than men. In my husband's life,
   his strongest role is in his job, but I have that and the role of wife
   and mother. We need a space to be just us - without the children." Time
   at home, alone, without chores, is still often felt as shirking
   responsibility. De Motte, for example, won't attend NWR meetings if her
   husband is away because employing a babysitter would "leave me
   guilt-ridden".

   So although most women can now define themselves by a paid job, it is
   often a definition in addition to, not instead of, domestic labour.
   Pauline Reymond, long-time NWR member and regional organiser in
   Worthing, joined the group when she was 29 and her child started
   school. Now 64, she notes that members have "partners" as well as
   husbands and many are divorced, widowed or remarried. Her life goes
   some way to explaining how, just as the term "housewife" has been made
   redundant by social forces, so it was also created by them. Reymond had
   to give up her job as a secretary at Royal Exchange Insurance because
   the company did not employ married women. "It was the way things were,"
   she says.

   Though Reymond would not have to leave her job today, some things
   haven't changed: no matter what we call them, it is still women who do
   most of the housework. The last Office of National Statistics figures
   showed that, at Â£739bn, unpaid housework was worth more than the value
   of the formal economy. And domesticity is still hard work. The best
   outcome to hope for, as far as the NWR goes, is that it will continue
   to fall victim to its own success.
