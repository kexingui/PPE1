Abstract

   This article attempts to demonstrate how the community subsidizes a
   married couple in which the wife stays at home, through the combined
   effect of tax and social security privileges. Contrary to what might be
   thought, this system is not even really designed to protect ‘the
   family’: it operates irrespective of whether there are any children or
   not. It is in fact intended to reward the couple in which the wife
   devotes herself to looking after her husband. It is quite likely that
   women who go out to work (and who also do their housework) bear more
   than their share of the cost of this, because of the ‘overpayments’
   that they are obliged to make in taxation and social security
   contributions. I propose that the system be abolished, as it
   corresponds to an out-of-date concept of marriage and has no
   justification from either the economic or the social standpoint. A
   housewife receives an income from her marriage and, if she actually
   does the housework, she improves the couple's standard of living. A
   number of working hypotheses are put forward in an attempt to see how
   the housewife could assume the normal responsibilities of a taxpayer
   and social security contributor.

   It is impossible (a) to assess the value of the services provided by
   the housewife in her sheltered environment and (b) even to know for
   certain what she really does there (many housewives employ charwomen or
   au pair girls or even full-time servants). However, when it is a
   question of granting to a widow an income related to what she had when
   her husband was alive, she is entitled to a specified fraction –
   usually half – of what her husband received or would have received. If
   this principle is valid with respect to benefits, it ought also to be
   valid with respect to obligations. Thus, the main proposal made here is
   that the housewife should pay income tax and social security
   contributions on a fictitious amount equivalent to half of her
   husband's earnings; this amount would be treated as ‘earned income’,
   which is the most favourable assumption from her standpoint. At the
   same time, the husband would pay income tax and his own social security
   contributions on the whole of his own earned income, as he would if he
   employed a housekeeper. The above-mentioned fictitious amount would
   also serve as the basis of calculation of the housewife's entitlement
   to social security benefits, subject to redistribution so as to assure
   a minimum subsistence in case of need. Reforms along these lines could
   only be put into effect gradually, since it would be unjust to penalize
   people from one day to the next for irresponsible behaviour which they
   have been deliberately encouraged to adopt up to the present.

   there is no longer a man to benefit?

   ^13 This penalization takes two main forms; either the wife's earnings
   are added to those of her husband and are thus taxed at a higher rate
   than would be justified if they were taxed separately, or else the
   earnings of the husband and the wife are taxed separately but at the
   higher rate, which is that generally applied to the earnings of single
   people at the same level of income. A man whose wife has no outside
   employment is in the last analysis the only beneficiary of the regime
   theoretically established for ‘married people’. A few countries have
   eliminated differences in tax rates and levels of taxable income based
   on marital status. In Great Britain, there is a difference in the
   personal allowance deductible from taxable income, which is higher for
   the ‘married man’; in addition, when she receives earned income, a
   married woman is granted a lower earned income relief than her husband.

   the lower earnings of women workers; the importance of contributions
   paid by women without corresponding benefits; and the extra cost to
   health insurance funds due to the fact that women (including

   exemption to the wife at home who unquestionably supplies services and
   so should not be included in the dependant class. In all justice the
   married status exemption should not be given when there is no dependant
   in the family … A childless couple has the right to decide that the
   wife will devote all her time to homemaking but there is no reason why
   the State should attach an advantage to this choice by giving the
   husband a married status exemption’ – Report of the Royal Commission on

   32

   ^32 The proposal could be construed as establishing an automatic
   correspondence between a housewife, on the one hand, and the cost of
   looking after children in the absence of the parents, on the other
   hand; it is based on the above-mentioned confusion arising from the
   attempt to justify the privileges granted to a housewife on the ground
   of the existence of children.
   33

   ^33 More or less everybody would receive it, except the housewife, who
   would not be entitled to it since she would not be employed outside the
   home. But she would become entitled to it on reaching the normal age of
   retirement.

   ^34 See Cockburn, Christine and Hoskins, Dalmer, ‘Social Security and
   Divorced Persons’, International Social Security Review, Year 29,
   1976CrossRefGoogle Scholar; and Hoskins, Dalmer, Problems of Divorce

   Divorced Persons, International Social Security Association, Round
   Table Meeting on Social Security Provisions in Case of Divorce,
   mimeograph, Geneva, 29 June – 1 07 1977.Google Scholar In the Federal
   Republic of Germany couples divorcing after 1 July 1977 share on an
   equal basis all the pension credits which have been accumulated at the
   time of divorce by either spouse during the years of marriage; pension
   credits are assigned on that basis to the account of the wife who has
   not been employed. As the scheme is earnings-related, the future
   old-age pension of the divorced husband will in this case undergo a
   corresponding reduction. A similar system of splitting pension credits
   has been proposed by the Canadian government.
   35

   ^35 For the purpose of simplification, only the working spouse's
   occupational earnings are taken into account. But it would also be
   possible to consider both the earned and the unearned income of the
   working spouse. This would have an impact on benefits as well as on
   obligations to pay.
   36

   ^36 The spouse who remains at home only half time and is employed
   during the other half of the time would be deemed to have an income
   corresponding to the addition of his or her earnings from outside work
   and 25 per cent of the other spouse's earnings.
   37

   ^37 This would also imply, of course, that the person at home would not
   be presumed to have 50 per cent of the spouse's earnings for purposes
   of social security entitlements, according to the principle that what
   one accepts as a beneficiary one should also accept as a payer.
   38

   ^38 It should be recalled that this value is only half of that of the
   total housework performed, since half of the housework is for the
   benefit of the spouse at home and should not be paid for by the working
   spouse.
   39

   ^40 Galbraith, op. cit. pp. 46–7.
   41

   ^41 If this approach were chosen, the couple in which both spouses work
   outside the home should be treated as having a total income of the
   household equal to their joint earnings, each paying taxes separately
   on half of that total. (Housework should not be considered in the case
   of such a couple, as is explained on p. 24.) This would retain the
   principle of income-splitting as it is applied in some countries for
   tax purposes, but without the fake distinction between ‘one-earner’ and
   ‘two-earner’ couples and without the present penalization of some
   married couples because the wife works outside the home.
   42

   ^42 We have not considered, for example, the consequences of the new
   system proposed from the point of view of benefits accruing to possible
   beneficiaries other than the spouse; the methods of financing social
   benefits; or the types of social security systems involved.
   43

   ^43 In addition, the new system proposed seems more just for the
   working spouse than the recent measures or proposals (see footnote 34)
   which deprive him or her of part of the fruit of his or her own labour
   by requiring that half of his or her social security contri butions
   should be credited to the spouse at home.
   44

   ^44 For example, if the income enjoyed by the person at home is assumed
   to be half of the other spouse's earnings, any substitute income which
   would be guaranteed under the social security scheme would normally be
   only a portion of that income – probably equivalent to around 25 per
   cent of the spouse's earnings. Voluntary insurance could ensure that
   such a portion is supplemented in order to guarantee to the person at
   home a substitute income equal to half of any substitute income of the
   working spouse. If the person at home is assumed to have half of a
   total income of the household, equal to 150 per cent of the working
   spouse's earnings, each of them could have social security entitlements
   based on half of that total; the working spouse would have an
   entitlement based on less than 100 per cent of the fruit of his or her
   own labour.
