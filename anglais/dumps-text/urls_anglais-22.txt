The educated housewife: A choice, not a chore

   The problem is not what women want and don’t want to do. The problem is
   that there is always someone who disapproves.

   Mina Niaza October 21, 2016
   Until recently I’d felt that feminism, when it came to women working,
   was baseless because in most modern families, women can choose to
   either work or stay at home. But I’ve come to realise that the only
   reason I feel this way is because I’m lucky enough to have been raised
   in an environment where I am not expected to give up my dreams because
   of something as trivial as my gender.
   Let me tell you a story.
   I know someone who married at the age of twenty-six, of her own accord.
   She had already completed her Bachelor’s degree with a distinction, and
   continued to work even after getting married. Her daughter was born,
   and only four years later she established her own practice. This woman
   has served on the board of a prestigious university, has been published
   numerous times, and now, two decades later, is fulfilling another dream
   and completing her Master’s degree on full scholarship.
   I’d say that’s a pretty accurate image of a well-established female.
   The woman’s husband supported her every decision, never once asking her
   to give up her dreams and stay at home. You say,

     “She would’ve have never been around, her kids must have suffered”?

   And yet, both her children are happy, healthy, and currently completing
   their O and A Levels from one of the most prestigious schools in the
   country.

     “They must have no family life,” you think.

   Wrong again. The four of them form a closer knit family than most –
   they regularly go out to the cinema together, they eat breakfast and
   dinner together, and no weekend is complete without at least one family
   or friend gathering.
   When her children were born she took time off  (about a year and a
   half, both times) after which she worked only part-time and switched to
   a smaller nearby office so that she could reach home within five
   minutes if needed.
   Despite having this strong female figure in her life, her daughter is
   different. She dreams of getting married in her early twenties with a
   huge desi wedding. She wants to stay at with home with her children.
   Are you thinking it must be because her mother neglects her family and
   the daughter doesn’t want to make the same mistake? No, she has never
   felt neglected, nor has she ever resented her mother’s career, quite
   the opposite actually, she respects her career. Are you feminists
   shaking your head at her? Are you assuming that it’s the only life she
   can have because she’s an airhead and can’t be successful? No, she is
   not dumb. She is intelligent. She manages to maintain outstanding
   grades at one of the most sought-after schools in the country, is
   applying to the top universities in the world, and has set high
   academic goals for herself so that she can be independent. The only
   difference is that after all this is over, she will choose to stop
   working and become a stay-at-home mom. Not because she is pressured
   into it or because that’s what her husband would want, but because that
   is what she feels would make her happier and is what she’d want to do
   with her own life.
   Personally, I relate to the daughter, and those close to me know this.
   I was therefore left dumbfounded and hurt when they tsk’d and judged me
   for sharing a post about how girls should not be forced to stay
   confined to the kitchen.
   Just because I feel that girls should not be bound to work in kitchens
   all day, doesn’t mean I’m saying girls should not cook because it
   degrades them.
   It was then that I realised the extent of the situation. The majority
   of us have segregated to two poles. The first is the age-old “a girl
   should only cook, clean, and stay home.” The second pushes women to be
   solely career driven.
   There is a stereotype of house-wives and stay-at-home moms being
   regarded as signs of subservience and accepted inferiority. The problem
   is that girls are expected by some to stay home, but looked down upon
   by others if they comply. Do you see the pattern? There is no right
   answer, and the girl’s own voice is lost somewhere in between.
   A middle ground must be reached, where a woman can choose to either
   work or stay at home. To achieve this, there must be a shift in
   mind-sets of both extremes. Being career-oriented does not necessarily
   translate into being a terrible homemaker. Choosing to stay home to
   take care of the family does not give people the right to judge her for
   “accepting male superiority.”
   The problem is not what women want and don’t want to do. The problem is
   that whatever they do, there will always be someone who will
   disapprove.
   Feminists fight to empower women but sometimes fail to realise that
   women at home are empowered too. I am not a radical feminist, I am not
   a chauvinist. Yes, I want to stay at home. And no, I am not oppressed.

   Abid | 6 years ago | Reply In Islam men and women have equal rights. It
   is misrepresentation of Islam to say that men has more rights than
   women, instead in Islam the responsibility of men are more than women.
   Decision making is a responsibility not a right therefore the decision
   of husband should be followed by wife. The difference between rights
   and responsibility is that if someone does not avail his rights he will
   not be questioned rather will be awarded in hereafter on the other hand
   if someone does not perform his responsibility he will be questioned
   and will asked in hereafter.
   Xyz | 6 years ago | Reply A woman has and should choose her course of
   life however she needs to also understand the realities. There is a
   reason why financial independence is so important for every individual,
   be it a man or woman. Life is not a fairytale - divorces, deaths,
   abandonment, spousal abuse - these are real. And often women find
   themselves stranded vulnerable to exploitation.

   Mina | 6 years ago | Reply And men don't understand them :) (Proof is
   the comment above in which facts were taken at face value instead of
   being analysed and understood)
   MR.X | 6 years ago Says a women who said 70% divorce =70% abusive
   men..Women were 100% correct who are angels and Gods greatest gift to
   earth??..You just proved your analysis and stating of facts is a lie
   and based on emotions..Farhan stands vindicated by his analysis of
   women
   farhan | 6 years ago Even people in the west are saying its due to
   feminism...Where are you living mars?...haha...Come one just told you
   facts and you interpreted them as you wanted to see. it dosent suit
   your interpretation of islam..Hypocrysy much..70% of women were
   oppressed so they took divorce..Its a factual statement as claimed by
   you...You analyze so good..70% divorce=70% oppressed women ..good
   logic..Just proves feminist think all men are bad,evil..
   Mina | 6 years ago | Reply Instead of blaming women for the increase in
   divorce rate, don't you think you should be a little smarter than that
   and think of why divorce rates increased? The rise in feminism simply
   made women realize that they should not be treated as if they were
   worthless or inferior to their husbands. So actually the rise in
   divorce rates just goes to show that 70% of women were living in
   abusive relationships, which in turn goes to show how messed up the
   mindset of most males is.
   Mina | 6 years ago | Reply Nowhere in any hadith does it specifically
   state that women cannot work. Bibi Khadija, the Prophet's first wife,
   was a businesswoman and the Prophet (pbuh) never asked her to stop
   working. Feelings are only being discussed because they are being hurt
   by uneducated people for unjustifiable reasons.
   farhan | 6 years ago and do you know that WHEN hazrat Khadija was alive
   the order of veil had not come..It was not revealed until she
   died..read sahih Bukhari and tafseer for further reference my
   sister..But i never said women are not allowed my sister..you just
   interpreted it wrongly..i just said you need husbands
   permission....This is islamic law and no one can change it
   Mina | 6 years ago | Reply The point is not that they should go out of
   their house even if their husband does not allow. The point is that the
   husband SHOULD allow.
   MR.X | 6 years ago upto the husband to decide....as per islamic law
   farhan | 6 years ago Its up to the husband to allow..not upto women
   ...This is clear from islamic law..you can consult anyone about this as
   it is clearly stated in Sahih Ahadith which i have personally
   read..Salam
   Fahim | 6 years ago | Reply Shy and feminine woman is ideal wife. Short
   tempered is not good, after marriage forgive your wife 70 times a day
   even any junior.
   MR.X | 6 years ago hmmm... i remeber the Prophets saying'treat women
   kindly, a women is liked a curved portion of a rib, if you try to
   starighten it, it will break'. This i read in Sahih Bukhari as i recall
   it..Sounds legit advice
   Fahim | 6 years ago | Reply Right but jokes apart it comes with a lot
   of benefits.
   MR.X | 6 years ago Fahim bhai, seeing these feminists these days, i
   want nothing to do with them, they are spoilt,narcisstic.. And i am
   short tempered and straight forward , i dont tolerate non-sense..Women
   actually feared me in university as per my friends..But then again they
   respected me and did not mess with me...i enjoyed it though...lol...i
   like shy and feminine women..
   Supriya Arcot | 6 years ago | Reply Women in applied professions like
   CA/Doc/Eng etc do injustice by wasting their education but if some one
   is bare basics like graduation (B.A , M.A ) etc., then yes the
   opportunity cost ( benefits otherwise ) are not much by 'sitting' at
   home.
   Mina | 6 years ago How can you say education is wasted? Education means
   attaining knowledge and everybody should have an equal right to
   knowledge regardless of what they may or may not choose to do with it.
   And if you mean in the sense that seats are wasted, then maybe people
   who DO want to work and not stay home should work harder and get better
   grades so that they can get those seats instead.
   Ravi Blr | 6 years ago | Reply To waste an education is criminal. All
   educated women should work, it benefits the woman, it benefits the
   family, and it benefits society and the country. Men cannot choose to
   sit at home after education, why do women feel they have a choice?
   Mina | 6 years ago Actually men do have a choice. They just don't
   exercise it because people will consider them slackers and shameless if
   they don't work. If their wife works instead then they can,
   essentially, stay home and look after the house and the children.
   Parvez | 6 years ago | Reply Nicely expressed....but you are talking of
   a very small percentage of people. In todays environment its the
   financial constraint that plays a big part in this decision. In many a
   family both parents HAVE to work in order to have a reasonable standard
   of living.
   ajay gupta | 6 years ago | Reply how can u be a pre medical student at
   grammar school? she aspires to go to med schl, is that what u mean?
   Hira Mirza | 6 years ago | Reply Since we are new to the concept of
   feminism and regard this only as a campaign adopted by the privileged
   class, it will probably take some time to strike a balance between the
   two extremes you have mentioned in your article. Nevertheless, we are
   learning to understand (sluggishly, yes) that every human being on this
   planet has his own mind and heart, so let's listen to what each says.
   MR.X | 6 years ago feminism is a failed concept..People in the west
   have seen its fruit..they themselves say that feminism caused high
   divorce rate..near 70 %.. In islam clearly husband has more right over
   his women ..or do you disagree with prophetic teachings which feminists
   indirectly lable as misogynst
   Razi Mallick | 6 years ago | Reply The article is juxtaposition of the
   girl’s inner feelings and till-formed opinions, which are still in the
   formative stage. But one thing seems evident, and that is her
   subconsciousness is reflecting dream of a family life galvanized with
   outpouring love and affection between husband and wife. Here I do not
   see any curse or rebellion against coercion but yearning for a serene
   family, living in an environment of cooperation and not confrontation.
   Imagine how a society would look like built on this foundation,
   especially in the prevailing environment where men and women have been
   pitted against each other. I would like to cite an example from the US
   2010 Census findings that twenty-four percent of the US children are
   living with single moms sliding down to further poverty, facing
   problems in transition from childhood to adulthood, and disconnected
   from the mainstream society. The innocent dream expressed by the girl
   gives me comforts and wish and pray for her dreams to be fulfilled
   Mina | 6 years ago Wow, thank you so much!
   Fahim | 6 years ago | Reply My wife had chosen herself to stay at home
   and YES I am OPPRESSED.
   MR.X | 6 years ago lol...so my fears about marriage are right??
   Shahzad Aslam | 6 years ago | Reply Very well written. A women should
   hear her own voice
   MR.X | 6 years ago | Reply yup, there are women who like to stay at
   home, like being provided for, this is their natural instincts and men
   are to provide for women as per islam ,,
   farhan | 6 years ago women are supposed to stay at home in islam..and
   cannot go out without their husbands permission according to Sahih
   Hadith
