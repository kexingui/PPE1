   Take a fresh look at what being a housewife in the 21st century really
   means and dispel some of the misconceptions about this timeless
   profession. Take a fresh look at what being a housewife in the 21st
   century really means and dispel some of the misconceptions about this
   timeless profession.

   Being a housewife in the 21st century puts you in a controversial
   position. Many people believe housewives are nurturing their families,
   making homes and building up society. Others are convinced housewives
   are old fashioned and outdated, responsible for thwarting the efforts
   of women who work outside the home and insulting the memory of those
   who worked so hard to obtain equal rights for women.

   What does it really mean – being a housewife in the 21st century?

Housewives in the 21st century are not ‘typical’

   There are no ‘typical’ housewives or stay at home moms anymore. We are
   all different, with different lifestyles and circumstances. Some of us
   have never worked outside the home, many of us have. Most of us are
   well educated – some of us are biochemists, neuroscientists, doctors,
   lawyers and more. Many of us have children, a number of us don’t. Some
   of us love what we do and wouldn’t have it any other way, others are
   doing it as a labour of love while they put their own dreams on hold.

We are not bored – or boring – nor are we uneducated

   Most of us are so busy that we get up earlier and go to bed later to
   try to fit more hours in the day. Honestly, I haven’t been bored since
   1991! Anyone who believes a housewife’s life is boring should come and
   spend the day with one.

   Most of us are well-educated, and many of us have degrees. Some of us
   have left well-paying jobs to take on our role as housewives.  We are
   well informed, politically active, contributing members of our
   communities who are just as comfortable discussing politics and
   socio-economic policy as anything else.

We are not anti-feminist

   Most housewives ARE feminists. The feminists who deride us seem to have
   forgotten that the whole premise of feminism was a woman’s right to
   choose her own path. The majority of housewives believe in that right
   no matter whether a woman decides to work outside the home, be a
   housewife or become prime minister. Feminism is meant to give women the
   right to choose, not dictate or restrict the choices we can make.

   Take a fresh look at what being a housewife in the 21st century really
   means and dispel some of the misconceptions about this timeless
   profession. Take a fresh look at what being a housewife in the 21st
   century really means and dispel some of the misconceptions about this
   timeless profession.

We are not all submissive

   My husband and I look on our roles as a partnership, no one of us above
   the other. We each perform roles that enhance the other, but they
   sometimes overlap. For example, I may do most of the cooking, but my
   husband (who is an awesome cook, but rarely has time for it) will often
   clean up the kitchen after supper.

   Yes, there were things I gave up over the years to be at home, but
   equally, I am continually inspired and humbled by the way my husband
   puts my needs and the needs of our family above his own.

We are NOT looking down on women who work outside the home

   Being a housewife in the 21st century doesn’t mean that we think every
   woman should be one. Not every woman wants to be a housewife nor should
   they be. We know that there is no proof that children raised by stay at
   home moms are any happier or well adjusted than those raised by women
   who work outside the home – or vice versa. We don’t think we are
   looking after our homes or our families better than anyone else. We
   respect every woman’s right to choose her career, be it outside the
   home or within it.

We are not all housewives ‘because we can afford to be’

   The decision to become a housewife or stay at home mom can have far
   reaching financial complications in the 21st century. Having only one
   income can mean having to tighten your belt and make sacrifices. It can
   mean spending years on a tight budget and struggling to make ends meet.
   While my husband and I now enjoy a very comfortable lifestyle, this was
   definitely the case for us for the first several years of our marriage.

We are not all kept women

   Many of us contribute to the family finances either through savings we
   have built up in earlier years or with our own businesses, often run
   from home. We also bring value to our homes by the tasks that we
   perform. Ever priced up hiring a nanny, personal assistant, housekeeper
   and accountant? Enough said.

We are not ‘ladies of leisure’ or ‘ladies who lunch’

   If you see a housewife out to lunch with a friend, it’s likely been
   scheduled for weeks and we are sandwiching it in between other
   commitments. It’s not a regular occurrence and we’ve probably been
   looking forward to it for ages. The ladies of leisure shown on certain
   ‘reality’ television programs? They are our bête noir and about as far
   from ‘real housewives’ as you can get.

What is being a housewife in the 21st century – really?

   In a nutshell, being a housewife in the 21st century is a profession in
   and of itself, a vocation and a labour of love. It’s a choice that
   deserves more than just a little respect. Being a Housewife in the 21st

       The word which resonated with me most strongly here was “choice”.
       If someone makes an informed decision to live their life a certain
       way then I’m sad that others feel justified in weighing in to
       criticise. But I suppose, as a society, we unfortunately have
       thousands of years of history in thinking we know best for the
       choices made by others concerning politics, religion, and so on.
       Sorry that you have to deal with this, April.

            Thank you, Pauline. I’m so glad the idea of ‘choice’ resonated
            with you as I really wanted to focus on that very thing. I
            agree, as a society we do have a long history of thinking we
            know best for others – you put that very well!

                 I am shocked people would say a stay home wife is not
                 feminine I would think it be if she worked outside of the
                 home she would be considered not feminine.

       Well said. I worked part time when I was single, then a little bit
       during our marriage, but I prefer staying home full time. Some
       women assume I want all women to stay home and it is not the case!

       LOVE LOVE this! “the whole premise of feminism was a woman’s right
       to choose her own path.” AMEN to that! Seriously I hate that it
       feels like I have to defend my choice to stay home, shouldn’t it be
       celebrated as with true feminism I have a right to choose and that
       was my choice; and for those that choose to work, I am happy for
       them and even am amazed at by them at times for all they do. We are
       all awesome and do things differently but as long as we are trying
       our best and loving our kids then life is good! Thanks for linking
       up with the #bestoftheblogosphere

            I agree. Feminism brought us choices. Stay home, work, have
            children, don’t have children. We should support and cheer
            each other on in our various paths.

       April, I love your article! I was able to be a housewife when we
       were raising our four children, if we needed some extra money I
       found things I could do out of the home to earn money. Now that our
       children are grown I still enjoy being a housewife! I find I never
       have enough time to do all the things I want to! Thanks for sharing
       your thoughts!

       People today can often be a bit too outspoken about things that are
       none of their business! I know women who are housewives and women
       who have careers outside the home. One of the housewives who comes
       to mind takes on so very much that she recently had a heart attack.

            I totally agree, Jean 🙂 And oh my goodness, I hope the lady
            who had a heart attack is okay! It’s amazing how we women push
            ourselves these days – both those of us who are housewives and
            those who work outside the home. We are only human after all!

       I’ve always worked outside the home, except for brief times of
       unemployment. My partner (male) has had longer times of
       unemployment and in recent years has been working from home. We
       feel it’s very obvious that SOMEBODY has to do the “homemaking”
       stuff; we can split it up and each be a part-time homemaker, but we
       can’t live comfortably without a homemaker. Although we have never
       chosen to arrange our family so that one of us is a full-time
       homemaker, that certainly seems like a valid way to do things.

       grandmother's life. In my adult life I’ve been shaking off
       “feminist” assumptions that everything women traditionally did is
       degrading. I’m pleased to see some signs that our society is
       becoming more egalitarian via men spending more time and taking
       more interest in nurturing children and in cooking at home (not
       just in restaurants or backyard grills); I think that’s far
       overdue!

       Loved this! I’m currently working outside the home for the next few
       weeks at least, until I have my first child and go on maternity
       leave. Our goal as a family is for me to stay home with our
       children until they go to school, which will mean lots of financial
       sacrifices as well as criticism from all directions for “giving up”
       on my career. That’s why I loved your line, “the whole premise of
       feminism was a woman’s right to choose her own path.” Feminism
       doesn’t mean tearing down women who choose different paths. It
       means supporting and encouraging each other in a world with equal
       opportunities for all.

       am a working woman. I am also a mother of two children. One just
       past the first decade of life, the other not halfway through. I am
       professionally qualified, am good at my work (if I may say so
       myself). I also have always wanted to work. As in be gainfully
       employed. As in earn in hard cash. As in be someone who can claim
       to have a direct financial contribution to the family. I have
       worked from before marriage, and have just continued doing so.
       Never thought seriously that I should not…. It helped that I have
       an understanding family. Ma in law who pitches in and hubby who
       does not mind the house going bonkers when my office workload hits
       the roof, which happens like every other day. I am not advocating
       that you should or should not work. Rather, am just putting in my
       two bit of wisdom.
       The comparision between ladies of leisure and working woman applies
       starkly in two situations:
       1. The working woman is a 9to 5er, who works at a lowly position to
       help in the finances, to ensure food on the table the next week,
       or, to ensure that kids can go to college.
       2. The lady of leisure is a lady of leisure because she chooses to
       be one, i.e. she is amply provided financially, has no worries
       about the coffers of the house.
       Most housewives,( and that is a misnomer, if any, which I too
       agree) complain that its unfair to say they dont work. They do. And
       I agree to it too. That they might not directly be paying bills,
       but are saving a lot of money in not making hubbies pay through the
       nose for them. But look at it from the other side of the spectrum.
       We as working women, do the household stuff and THEN go to office.
       At least those who are doing the job because they need th money. We
       get up early, pack the kids lunch boxes, our own, clean up the
       house, lock up and go to the office to work eight to ten, sometimes
       more, hours. We come back, do all that needs to be done (though
       laundry and dirty dishes are the last on the to do list) make kids
       study, listen to their worries, be nurse, psychologist, teacher
       cook maid etc etc. in this short time, and then get rest. We miss
       out on seeing the summer bloom, the winter frost, we miss out on
       most of the kids milestones, because we have to work. We feel envy
       when we see the lunch ladies, which admittedly they went after
       serious planning et all, but which we cant, because a half day
       leave that we would need from office for that lunch date, is so
       much better utilised in taking kids to the dentist.
       So lady friends of mine, before you pat yourselves on the back
       saying the women who work are being sarcastic, please read this
       carefully:
       1. We hate it when our housewife friends say “its so good that your
       kitchen work is over by 9 am, I have to slog over the stove till 2
       in the afternoon”, after 9, we have to rush to the office to do
       something else, which you obviously dont do, for whatever reason.
       2. It jars our brains when you pride over how you “clean your house
       from top to bottom every fortnight, my _____(put the name of your
       son / daughter / husband / dog) cannot tolerate dust”. Please, we
       dont have the luxury of allowing our son / daughter / husband / dog
       to be intolerant to dust.
       Now tell me, who is being smug, intolerant and is backbiting. And
       last but not the least, since feminism is about choices, it should
       be both ways, we respect yours, you respect ours. And not just
       choices but everything, including our situations. It might be that
       if our situations are reversed, we might both be unable to cope.

            Thank you for your comment but you have completely misread and
            misinterpreted my article. Every family makes tough choices
            and I am so sorry you feel so bitter. I am very sad that you
            have taken my article – which was meant to be supportive of
            both women who work outside the home and women who are
            housewives as well as to be a positive reinforcement of how
            women need to stick together and not criticise one another –
            and twisted it the way that you have. It sounds to me as if
            some of your “housewife friends” have not been as supportive
            as I would be and that makes me sad too. And I must stress
            again that I am not and never will be a “lady who lunches” –
            although when I do have the opportunity to go to lunch I am
            very grateful. I also want to point out that neither my
            husband nor my son are intolerant to dust and I would never,
            ever criticise another woman’s home or her life choices. I
            hope that you manage to find some happiness in the future – it
            sounds like you have had to work so hard that you have missed
            much joy.

                 Thanks April.
                 The bitterness in part may also come from envy on my
                 side, since I do not consider myself to have had a very
                 hard life anyway. God has been kind to me in myraid ways.
                 It is also, in part because we belong to two very diverse
                 regions, India, is not a very conducive place to have a
                 career. But being a housewife is way easier since help is
                 cheap here. So maybe I was bringing my regional
                 experience, which you obviously would not be able to
                 relate to.
                 Best of luck to you too.

       Hi again April! Lately, I’ve been getting all sorts of comments
       from nosy people, asking me where I work, what I do. Then when I
       say I’m a housewife they spill all sorts of negative comments ad
       judgment. I am married to my husband, not them! Do you ever get
       those? If so, how do you react? I need some help!

            Hi there! Yes, I’ve definitely had negative comments and they
            can be really hurtful. It’s often hard to know exactly what to
            say but I think the most important thing is not to take the
            nasty comments to heart. Having said that, I also think you
            should definitely calmly disagree with them. I’m just guessing
            at comments you may have had here but “I’m far too busy (or I
            simply don’t have time) to be bored / lazy / unfulfilled” has
            worked well for me in the past as has “Me being a housewife
            works extremely well for my husband and I.” If they have been
            very rude I would add “Your assessment of the situation is
            completely inaccurate and honestly, it’s none of your
            business.” I hope that helps. If you have some specific
            negative comments you are okay with sharing I’d be happy to
            try to help more specifically. If you prefer, you can email me
            at april@apriljharris.com. I hope this helps!

                 Thanks, it helps! I’ve been called “just a 50’s housewife
                 waiting for her husband to come home”, which isn’t true,
                 and just in general, many women just stare at me and say
                 “you don’t work”, which is quite annoying!

                      Those are mean comments and very untrue as well! It
                      sounds a bit like the commenters might be jealous,
                      although I know that doesn’t help when people are
                      hurtful! Maybe try “I’m far too busy to sit around
                      waiting for anyone” or “Maybe you don’t work around
                      your home but I sure do!” as responses. I’m really
                      glad I could help a bit but I hope people will be
                      kinder in future!

            Thank you, Mary. I’m really glad you enjoyed this post. I’m
            sorry you are feeling bored sometimes – I have very little
            time to pursue my hobbies these days as I am so very busy so I
            never feel bored. In fact, I am always wishing for some free
            time. However, when I was just starting out as a young
            homemaker, I looked for ways to expand what I was doing to
            help support my husband and the family. (Of course, you need
            to discuss with your husband the things that would be most
            helpful for you both.) So, for example, I began to look after
            the day to day finances, I managed our family social calendar
            etc. I also included activities like regular exercise and
            maintenance of myself as well as our house. Also, like anyone,
            homemakers need hobbies that they enjoy – perhaps you enjoy
            reading or sewing or some form of art? It’s important to keep
            learning as well, so I made sure to read widely about current
            events and other things that interested me as well as to visit
            places like art galleries and museums when I could. I hope
            this helps 🙂

       Loved this post. I am a stay at home wife and it makes our lives so
       much easier…and more pleasant! I have dinner already done, most
       days, when my husband gets home from work which allows us to have a
       more relaxing evening. I do a ton of house work during the week so
       on the weekends we can go out and enjoy doing things instead of
       cleaning or running errands. I love being able to maintain the
       house while my husband works because then it gives us more
       “us”time! It is a little hard on me sometimes since the only money
       I bring in now is from the little bit I make on my blog. Thank you
       for sharing this article. I thought it was great!

       I am a young girl of 17 and my lifelong dream is to be a good wife
       and mother. As you can imagine, however, I get teachers asking me
       why I am even bothering with University and all my girlfriends joke
       about how I’m a male supremacist. This is why I’ve been looking
       around for articles that showcase different experiences of women
       who have chosen this lifestyle and what I have noticed is a common
       trend: they are extremely happy! it fulfils them. That being said,
       I am obviously too young to know what my life will turn out to be,
       but thank you so much for this post! It really makes excellent
       points and gives me some ways to respond to anyone who criticises

            I’m so glad you liked the article, Mina, and I’m so glad it
            helps. It makes me sad that your teachers would ask why you
            are bothering with university. Whatever choices we make in our
            lives, it is important to take advantage of all the
            educational opportunities open to us, and to keep learning
            throughout our lives. Plus, you can definitely be a feminist
            whether you work outside the home or not. I’m really glad you
            have noticed a trend of many women being fulfilled by this
            lifestyle, that is very encouraging. You are right, you are
            very young and you have your whole life before you – but what
            you decide to do is up to you. I encourage you to definitely
            go to university and have lots of great experiences, choose to
            work at something you love, and the rest will follow. Thank
            you so much for your kind comment. I wish you all the very

       I loved this article and it totally resonated with me. I have been
       a “stay at home mom” for the last 16 years and it is truly what I
       love to do. What a lot of people in my life don’t realize is in
       that time I have also held many many part-time/ work at home, side
       jobs that most people don’t “see”. It is so frustrating to have
       certain people look at you and give you that skeptical look when
       you say you are busy. I hate feeling like I have to justify my time
       and one of the most frustrating things is when people ask, “So,
       what do you do for a living?” The assumption that I am stupid or
       uninteresting is so galling. Anyways, thank you so much for summing
       up what being a housewife in the 21st century is like.

       I’m a guy who ended up in a situation working part-time and taking
       care of an elderly woman and living in the same house that she
       wants to keep. Lots of elements there but the upshot is that I do
       ALL the work around the house. I see more-than-ever the huge and
       increasing possibilities for a revolution in woman-driven
       housekeeping and care-giving not just for children but for seniors
       in the family. It’s really quite incredible. Just a few examples….
       1. Kitchen work– I’ve installed lots of extra shelving and table
       space in our kitchen so that not only do I start the day as a
       prep-cook but also start out looking at what supplements need to be
       updated and shopped for online or at the health food store.
       Nutrition is increasingly demanding– including extra supplements
       for chelation to keep the arteries clean and supplements to help
       bowel movement– all delivered in the preferred formats. It’s never
       ending.
       2. Backyard work at the home– Again, endless possibilities… and for
       the so-called libertated lumber-jack woman wearing jeans and
       toolbelt, there’s lots of fences to fix, roofing to maintain… and
       water heaters to flush. Typically thought of as men’s jobs, todays
       all-around woman– if she wants to expand her idea of herself as
       supermom– could expand into those areas while the
       outside-contractor-husband can focus on his job outside the home.
       3. Childhood education- I teach piano lessons, on the outside… and
       on the inside at home– and this area has not been fully tapped.
       Every child has to be custom-educated– once the general-outline is
       delivered. Every day I come up with a new idea for a lesson I want
       to try delivering in a new way. What woman-in-her-right-mind as a
       baby-maker-best-between-20-and-30 would WANT to
       “work-outside-the-home” when there is THIS much to do INSIDE the
       home?
       4. As a guy, I wish I would have found a woman who sees the
       possibilities for stay-at-home-housewife like I do. Unfortunately,
       they all ended up wanting to compete-like-men-outside-the-home….
       one worked overtime in computer conversion, another in accounting,
       another in real-estate. Women would do better– and I would venture
       to say MOST women– would do better by tending to their
       family-home-building-skills than their
       competitve-outside-world-skills… and then “sell” that ability to
       the “competitive outside man”.

            now 🙂 I did do some part time work in the early part of that
            time, and of course I have the blog and other projects, but
            I’ve always considered myself a housewife first. I think a lot

       Beautiful I don’t want repeat every word that you said. I agree not
       because I am a Housewife, I agree because I was a single woman
       before, and now this experience has been the best rewarding and
       knowledgeable experience I ever have. Is not just about the
       sacrifice is about the time I have to slow down and see the world

       Thank you April for your article. I found it because I did a Google
       search asking if it is okay to be a homemaker in America so I could
       see what was written about it. After sifting through the list of
       hits that all focused on the financial savings for families doing
       this, I found yours which is more encompassing instead of narrowing
       it to simply a financial decision.
       Honestly the reason I did a search is because I have realized I
       have my own inner insecurities and feelings of inadequacies, and
       that this is what drives any sort of negative impact of
       misunderstanding comments from outsiders. I am looking honestly at
       myself and seeking inner peace.
       My historically typical M.O. of calling myself a stay-at-home Mom
       doesn’t work anymore and hasn’t for some time because my daughter
       is a Senior. So I have been avoiding the transparent answer by
       pointing at some sort of short term circumstance impacting me at
       that particular time or saying something about not working right
       now followed by talking about jobs I have held in the past and that
       I will go back to that some time…which I don’t know if I actually
       will.
       Anyway, I am doing some inner searching and your article will be
       part of that as I consider internally each aspect you’ve discussed
       as it pertains to how I view my own value. Once I have made peace
       with my own decision and my value as a person, I am fully confident
       that when the misunderstanding comments or barbs of outsiders are
       expressed I will be able to respond by graciously clarifying the
       reality and respectfully setting boundaries. I am looking forward
       to the journey toward inner freedom and external connections with
       people based on truth and respect.
       Have a good day.

            as our children grow older, and society’s notion of what we
            ‘should’ do is often not what we truly want for ourselves. It
            is so ironic that in the space of only a few generations we
            have gone from a situation where women who dared to work
            outside the home were criticised, to being criticised for
            deciding to become (and/or remain) a housewife. Whatever your
            decision or however you choose to describe what you decide to
            do, know that you are valued and important, and that you are
            doing what is best for yourself and your family. Blessings on
            your journey as you navigate this time in your life, and thank
            you again.

            Hi Cheryl,
            This portion of your comment really resonated with me:
            “Honestly the reason I did a search is because I have realized
            I have my own inner insecurities and feelings of inadequacies,
            and that this is what drives any sort of negative impact of
            misunderstanding comments from outsiders. I am looking
            honestly at myself and seeking inner peace.”
            I feel similarly and I’m curious how far you are on your
            journey towards inner freedom, and what steps/strategies have
            helped you along the way. Thanks for your openness, and thanks
            to April for the original post that generated all these
            comments 🙂

       I love love this article
       But major concern of mine is I hope the husband does not make one
       feel inferior about this choice
       Cause I genuinely feel being a housewife is not a bad thing at all
       .

            Thank you so much, Maymunah. I agree, it is very important
            that the husband honours his wife’s choice and encourages her.

       Lovely to read this 😊 I have 3 children and a dog (basically 4
       children with the dog lol) and my husband works full-time. I have
       an auto immune disease that leaves me exausted most of the time so
       I’m a stay at home wife/mum, we would financialy be better off if I
       worked full time as well as my husband but I just don’t know how I
       could possibly fit it all in, these woman that work full time with
       a family as well I salute you because you must be super women and I
       wish I had your energy. I feel our lives would be pointless if I
       worked full time because there would be no one home to get anything
       done and no one to spend time with the children. I absolutely love
       being a mum and making my home feel like a home, my home is not
       perfect by any means but I do get fulfillment from doing my best.
       Yes we could do more expensive days out with the children and go
       out for meals but at what cost? I would be exausted beyond belief,
       grumpy and have zero quality time with my family. I don’t drive but
       my husband does and we always do something as a family together on
       a weekend, things that don’t cost the earth but create beautiful
       memories like visiting country parks, woodland walks and saving up
       little by little so we can have our summer holiday in the country
       that we all love so much in August. I also love and I mean love to
       read, sew, make homemade jams etc and try to fit one of these
       pleasurable things into my day because life is to short and we
       should all try to do things that make us happy. These little things
       that I love probably make me sound very old fashioned but I really
       do enjoy them and enjoy looking after my home and family. I really
       do feel judged so much by people when I say only my husband works
       because I feel that it’s expected of woman these days to work and
       bring up a family at the same time. X

            It is so challenging living with an auto-immune or chronic
            disease, Deborah, however it sounds like you have created the
            perfect balance. I’m so very glad this article resonated with
            you. Your children will have such wonderful memories of their
            childhood, and I love that you find these wonderful home
            crafting pursuits so fulfilling. I confess, I am not very good
            at sewing, but I totally know what you mean about loving the
            old fashioned things.
            I think a lot of people expect a lot of things these days, but
            many of them are misguided Try to ignore the people with too
            many opinions. We all have to do what works for us and I’m so
            glad you have found a way to make a lovely, happy home and
            family life. X

       I just stumbled upon your post after deciding to fully embrace
       being a housewife/future sahm. After an early career in Corporate
       America and recently finishing graduate school, I realized that the
       most important thing to me is family, nurturing my home space, and
       living a life of individual and familial balance. Instead of
       worrying about societal pressures and external judgements, I
       courageously decided to pursue the path I truly desire. As a
       result, my husband and I are no longer “putting off” having
       children and I have never experienced more happiness and peace than
       I do now! Thank you for taking the time to encourage women to
       pursue their individual dreams! 🙂

       I enjoyed the reading. You made very good points and answered
       questions I had. I’m a teacher and over the years have realized my
       purpose in my life is to nurture. The second part of my life maybe
       leading to becoming a housewife. Do you have a instagram or
       Facebook page and or a podcast? I’m looking for to reading your
       past articles and future readings!

       agreed. almost all throughout my 20s I never even bothered
       attempting to assert myself as wanting to be a housewife, because
       it seemed at this point that all women are expected to work as much
       as a man. I was afraid of looking like a golddigger. but eventually
       I found someone at a time when I was more willing to take risks,
       and when I admitted what I want out of life, he offered exactly
       what I wanted. we faced a ton of pushback from his parents and
       their friends even though we got married. it was rough to handle.
       but it’s been a handful of years now and even if we still don’t
       have the support from them that we should, I no longer feel I must
       have it in order to be at peace.
       I did feel as a young child that my mom going back to work would
       change things for the worse, and they really did. she wasn’t able
       to focus on us kids as much anymore and things went downhill. I’m
       so glad that despite women’s lib hypocrisy, I finally can make up
       for my own losses, and stay home to raise my own kids one day. in
       the meantime it’s really awesome to finally see that housewifery
       isn’t dead unless I want it to be.

            Thank you, Alison.
            I agree, we all have to find our own path. I am so glad you
            are following yours, despite pressure and pushback. It’s so
            important that everyone do what works for them, even if not
            everyone agrees.
            Women’s liberation was originally all about women being able
            to choose what they wanted to do. Sadly, in some cases, that
            original idealism has been lost to pressure for all women to
            do the same thing. It’s so important we are able to choose to
            do what works for us and for our families, whether that’s to
            be a housewife, have a career or any combination of the two.
            I’m glad being a housewife works for you, as it has for me.
            I’m so pleased the article resonated with you. Thank you again
            for commenting!
            Best wishes!

       Well spoken. Love your choice of words, Brilliant in so many ways.
       I’m 24, pregnant with my second child, the firstborn is 3. Though
       the idea of being a housewife/homemaker/stay-at-home mom was never
       even something that crossed my mind before I got pregnant with my
       first child, it’s now something I enjoy and value so much,
       especially now that I’m pregnant, and after having had to pause my
       studies in my first pregnancy. I still have plans to pursue my own
       individual dreams, but right now I’m taking full advantage of being
       home full-time, settling into marriage and giving my 3 year old as
       much attention as I can give to him

       Wow, I love this perspective on both housewife/mom and working
       wife/mom. I don’t like the term housewife and prefer CEO of
       home…lol. But I can totally agree with everything you mentioned in
       this article. I particularly love the part where you say it’s a
       choice, we’re not submissive, and “we can afford to be”….such good
       points. In my situation, it was not much of choice, but I realized
       it was the ‘best choice’ at the time. My husband and I are equally
       vested in running the household. Although he is the income
       provider, hubby always says it’s our money because I am his partner
       and wife. I am far from submissive. Financially we are ok, do I
       wish we had more money? Of course!! Who doesn’t during these times,
       but we are pretty comfortable. Of course, I am working on building
       my online business from home and he’s supportive of my goals and
       business plan. At first, I was very resistant to being home and I
       was ‘itching’ to be in the ‘workforce’. Now I wouldn’t have it any
       other way. I have respect for ALL women whatever they choose to do.
       However, we all know that being home is often a thankless job. As
       long as my family appreciates what I do, I don’t care what society
       or anyone else thinks. Great post!!
