Suicide and Indian Housewives

   In India, the chances of dying by suicide jump drastically if a woman
   is a housewife

   Writer and philosopher Albert Camus, in Myth of Sisyphus, wrote, "There
   is only one serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide." Camus
   recognized the universality, complexity, and massive toll that suicide
   takes on society far ahead of the promoters of mental health.

   According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates, globally,
   817,000 people died of suicide (or self-harm) in 2016. The largest
   democracy with over a billion people, India, is infamously the suicide
   capital of the world with over 230,000 suicides, or 28 percent of the
   global total. So, looking at suicide in the context of India is
   pertinent to all who work on global mental health and injuries.

   Epidemiologically, around the globe, suicide deaths are a bigger
   problem in men than in women. Twice the number of men died due to
   suicide in 2016 compared to women. According to the India State-Level
   Disease Burden Initiative Suicide Collaborators' study, this gap is
   narrower in India, where the male-to-female suicide death ratio is
   1.34—that is 134 suicide deaths in men for every 100 suicide deaths in
   women. The 2016 suicide death rate among Indian women was 2.1 times
   more than that among women globally.

Indian Women and Vulnerability to Suicide

   Of particular concern are young Indian women in the 15- to 34-year-old
   age group who contribute to 63.4 percent of suicide deaths among women
   in the country. Suicides are ranked as the number one cause of death
   among young (15-39 years) Indian women.
   28 Percent

   India is infamously the suicide capital of the world with over 230,000
   suicides, or 28 percent of the global total

   The Million Death Study (MDS), a nationally representative mortality
   survey, also had similar findings. Indian women in the 15- to
   29-year-old age group contributed to 56 percent of all suicides among
   women, with a median age of 25. This study also showed that compared to
   high-income countries (HICs), suicide death rates for young women were
   two times or greater in this age group in India.

   Researchers have attempted to figure out the possible reasons
   underlying high suicide death rates among Indian women. Multiple
   analyses using data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) point
   to marital problems, bad marriages, and the end of a marriage. MDS did
   not find that marriage has a protective effect against suicide—a factor
   observed in other countries.

   However, looking at deaths alone does not yield a complete picture. It
   is well established that while deaths due to suicide might be lower in
   women than men, suicidality is higher. According to the National Mental
   Health Survey of India (2015-16), the prevalence of
   suicidality—nonfatal suicidal thoughts and behaviors—among Indian women
   is about 1.5 times greater than it is among Indian men. This survey
   also noted that suicidality was consistently higher among women than
   men across age groups, socioeconomic strata, and regions of residence.
   When looking at the sociodemographic factors that are related to
   suicidality, being married or divorced/separated puts women at greater
   risk for suicidality than being single (for example, never married).
   This is particularly important given that the colloquial conception,
   borrowed heavily from the HIC literature, relies on the notion of
   isolation as a risk factor for suicide and suicidality. Indian women
   who are ever married—married at one time but who may or may not be
   currently married—seem to face the dangers of suicide more than one
   would expect.

   There is a particular subgroup among women who are ever married, that's
   also striking: housewives or homemakers who spend several thousand
   hours doing unpaid work such as cooking, cleaning, caring for the
   elderly and children, and managing resources and finances day-to-day in
   the household. Over the past twenty years, consistently, a fifth of
   women dying due to suicide in India have been housewives. Previously, a
   study that statistically ranked gender-specific factors for suicide
   found that among women in the age groups 15-29, 45-59, and under 60 who
   died due to suicide, the main professional category was housewife. The
   major reasons cited were dowry disputes and cancellation/non-settlement
   of marriage among 18- to 30-year-old women, and
   cancellation/non-settlement of marriage and family problems among 30-
   to 45-year-old women.

   Even with underreporting, NCRB data underscores the suicide problem
   among Indian housewives. In 2019 (pre-COVID), of the total 139,123
   recorded suicides, 41,493 (29.82 percent) were women and 21,359 who
   died due to suicide were housewives. Housewives made up 51.48 percent
   of the women, and 15.35 percent of total suicides. When we analyze NCRB
   suicide deaths among women by professional categories, housewives
   formed the largest segment relative to other professional categories.

   Importantly, these numbers also depict regional variations across
   states and union territories (UTs) (Figure 2). Thirteen
   states/UTs—including Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat,
   and Karnataka—have particularly high rates of suicide among housewives,
   higher than the national average in this group.

   While the previous studies and the above analyses depict high suicide
   death rates and risk among housewives, they also help tell us the
   probability of dying from suicide if a person is a housewife. Drawing
   from their findings, we used the Bayes Theorem, which is quite popular
   among a wide range of analysts—from epidemiologists to machine learning
   scientists—and is part of every biostatistics curriculum, to calculate
   this. We found that the probability of death due to suicide jumps from
   0.013 percent to 2.74 percent (greater than 200 hundred-fold) for an
   Indian woman solely by virtue of being a housewife.

Factors Connected with Suicide in Indian Women

   A multiplex of biological, psychological, and social factors could be
   responsible for the high risk of suicide among housewives. Physical and
   sexual abuse, hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle and
   pregnancy, and the presence of psychiatric disorders are some of the
   known contributors to suicide in women. These contributors could
   exacerbate suicide risk among housewives who have severely limited
   financial freedom, limited social agency, and lack of recognition for
   their work, and among those whose health problems may not be attended
   to well. They are important, yet well-being and quality of life among
   Indian housewives have been understudied. A small sample of studies
   suggest that housewives have poorer quality of life compared to
   working, married women who report higher self-esteem, and less
   hopelessness and insecurity than housewives, but more research is
   needed in this area.

     The probability of death due to suicide jumps more than 200
     hundred-fold for an Indian woman solely by the virtue of being a
     housewife

Addressing Suicide in Women

   After adopting a holistic approach toward mental health in its National
   Mental Health Policy (2014) and decriminalizing suicide in its recent
   Mental Healthcare Act (2017), the next pertinent step for India is to
   invest in solving the suicide epidemic in an evidence-informed and
   needs-based fashion. Suicide needs to be treated as a biopsychosocial
   problem impacting individuals, groups, and communities. The World
   Health Organization's Framework for public health action toward suicide
   prevention is a key resource that can help policymakers design a
   national suicide prevention strategy that includes housewives as a
   vulnerable group requiring attention. The high-level policies can be
   supported by the grassroots efforts of nonprofits such as the Suicide
   Prevention India Foundation (SPIF). Upcoming community-level
   interventions led by community health workers can potentially benefit
   women and particularly housewives. Comprehensive surveillance systems
   are of utmost importance to fill in data gaps and improve the
   collective understanding of the issue. Suicide prevention helplines
   such as AASRA and iCall, and suicide first-aid guidelines can be
   directly useful for helping housewives.

   While Camus theorized surrendering to life's absurdity as a
   philosophical solution to the problem of suicide, India's social
   solution to the problem lies in preventing suicides among its most
   remarkable yet least appreciated population—the housewives and
   homemakers.

   AUTHOR'S NOTE: ​​I would like to clarify that we intend to be accurate
   and sensitive toward the issue of gender identity. As a researcher, I
   further appreciate the complexity of the associations among biological
   sexes and gender identities and roles that give rise to the rich
   diversity of human self-identity and self-expression. The available
   data and literature compel me to use the terms "women" or "females"
   interchangeably. However, I realize that mental health issues across
   the gender-sex spectrum vary greatly and need further research and
   policy attention, particularly for marginalized groups. Hopefully,
   future research will allow more complete and sophisticated analyses.
