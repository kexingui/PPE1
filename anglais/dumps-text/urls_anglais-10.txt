   Normally, the treatment of literary or theoretical texts relies on some
   kind of configuration of a text's content and the formal patterns put
   together within an already established context. Although the organising
   principles may vary considerably, the technique always comes down to a
   set of connections that are held together by the text.

   These connections can be explicitly causal, building up the narrative,
   or associative not following a linear logic so that the only way to
   make the connection is to follow the intentions of the author. Our
   world or culture happens to organise things in a way that means that
   explicitly causal arguments are evidence of scientific, critical or
   documentary writings, while intentional, associative and
   often-fragmented connections are understood as signs of artistic
   literature. Pursuing these stereotypical assumptions, one finds that
   criticism, science and documentation are linked to an external public
   while the literary artistic text is associated - at least since the
   19th century - with an internalised, private subjectivity. To write an
   'objective', 'distant' and therefore 'cold' poetic text is still
   perceived as a somewhat transgressive act, just as criteria like
   'taste' or similar seemingly subjective terms provoke confusion when
   used in scientific analysis. While today, in the field of writing,
   those borders are still amazingly intact; in the visual field there has
   been a much stronger amalgamation, at least on the artistic side.
   Conceptual and installation art have steadily eroded the division
   between 'subjective' art and 'objective' science and in many current
   forms of Kontextkunst it seems to have disappeared entirely. Another
   indication of developments in the visual arts is the role of critics
   and curators, who, for many conservatives, is simply not distinguished
   enough from the role of the artist him or herself, while at the same
   time artists are pilloried for writing theoretical and critical texts.

   Many of Frances Stark's essays are uncertainly located between cultural
   criticism and poetry, placing her within an established tradition of
   other visual artists such as the Danish Cobra member Asger Jørn or
   Franz West. Jørn defined his own form of science in his writings, doing
   so in order to turn it into a publicly accessible concept. Franz West
   took apart texts by Lacan and Wittgenstein in order to re-examine the
   individual parts in terms of both their content and formal qualities.
   Such texts by visual artists often appear hybridised or as samples that
   avoid classification as one particular genre of writing. One reason for
   the ease with which artists can mix genres might relate to the way
   collage and over-painting are already taken for granted in modernist
   art. However, an individual like Frances Stark is not simply a visual
   artist who writes, everything we know makes it clear that her writing
   is of equal value to her visual production. In conversations with the
   artist I noticed very early on one her particular habit of continuously
   reading other writers. While the process of reading a literary or
   scientific text would normally come to some kind of end or even a final
   'over and done with', for Stark reading is just the beginning of
   further re-readings and re-contextualisations to be repeated over and
   over again. These readings create a permanent new language, a fusion
   between her text and the other that becomes impossible to separate
   because both are parts of the same architecture. In one of her columns
   in Artext titled 'Knowledge Evanescent' it first seems possible to
   identify a line of thought leading from one quote to the other, from
   Rudolf Steiner to J.D. Salinger, and all the way to Gurdjieff. However,
   this quotational level of the text is regularly interrupted by various
   biographical reflections mixing her own thoughts on various literary
   figures with reactions to her students and her own personal story. It
   becomes less and less clear if one level determines the other or if
   everything has already flowed together. A footnote becomes a reminder
   to the author herself to read a text, while her situation as a teacher
   overlaps with a TV series about an art student. She first hears the art
   student in the background of a phone conversation with her gallerist
   and later learns about her progress from her real art students. On
   points like this fiction and theory intertwine with her biography to
   such an extent that it is impossible to identify a beginning or end
   anymore. Nevertheless the title of the essay can't just be taken
   literally - knowledge rather manifests itself in fleeting
   disappearances between all the different levels.

   These various levels become even more obvious in the book The Architect
   & The Housewife where they are located in the dichotomies between
   public and private, outside and inside, male and female. This is a book
   about the essential questions of modernism. In the beginning, it quotes
   Oscar Wilde's The Artist as a Critic: 'If you wish to understand others
   you must intensify your own individualism' - private differentiation as
   a pre-condition for an outside understanding in public. Before that we
   find another line of association, to do housework with a kitchen cloth
   means a housewife, while the term housewife in the public realm of the
   Internet means porn. Then we jump from Weininger's definition of the
   female between (private) mother and (public) prostitute to Wittgenstein
   and then quickly back to Weininger and his definition of genius as
   resistance against the female. In between there is a short
   consideration of the home of the housewife, a building that would not
   be possible without an architect. This short staccato somehow fails to
   make it clear whether the private is developed as a public concept or
   the public as a private concept. It only points out the impossibility
   of separating them out.

   The home and its interiors feature in the first part of the book, but
   mainly it is about fear and its connection to the home, its privacy and
   loneliness. The genius of Stark's text is again this interweaving of a
   personal situation with reflections about art, as, for instance, when
   installation art is defined in terms of the relationship between inside
   and outside, or between the architect and the housewife. There are
   certainly plenty of other essays that deal with these spaces and their
   context as a central motif for cultural analysis, but Frances Stark
   develops this subject out of her own dialectic, allowing endless
   reversals if not total oppositions to emerge. By locating the effect of
   literature as an internal process, she allows it to unfold first in the
   spirit. This spirit, bound by the limitation of our intellect and
   perceptual possibilities, stands in contrast to the infinity of our
   thoughts. One thing becomes clear in The Architect & The Housewife,
   writing about public and private is in itself thinking in a public
   space. This becomes apparent in the text because there is no
   theoretical reference or consideration that is not already imbedded in
   a private context. At one point Stark deals with a text by Daniel Buren
   where he talks about the studio and 'the unspeakable compromise of the
   portable work of art'. Buren, speaking as a modernist and, even more
   so, a minimalist, discusses the impossibility of transporting an
   artwork into a 'neutral' exhibition space when it is always united with
   a particular location. In quoting this, Stark also contextualises it -
   a couple having to enter into compromises in order to resolve
   differences. This passage is then followed by a short paragraph about
   couples leading up to the quote by Adolf Loos 'all art is erotic' and
   thus returning again to architecture.

   Throughout the whole essay, Stark discusses contradictions while at the
   same time alternating between different levels of text that to a
   greater or lesser extent respond to the contradictions discussed while
   doing so in such a quick and seamless way that they define and dissolve
   those opposites at the same time. Not accidentally she quotes the film
   Safe by Todd Haynes in which the protagonist develops an allergy
   against her whole environment, though it is never exactly explained
   whether this was due to external or internal causes. Long sections of
   the book are also given over to the Californian artist Jorge Pardo,
   whose own artistic practice, addresses the ambiguous space between
   architectural design and artistic sculpture and who has recently
   produced a whole house as a sculpture. This can be read as a parallel
   to Frances Stark's texts. Spaces occupied by only one position simply
   don't exist anymore. Just as architecture sometimes ventures from the
   functional into the realm of the decorative, so art can itself tread
   onto the territory of the functional.

   Eventually the formalist divisions between modernisms and
   postmodernisms break up to the point that their forms can change
   meanings precisely according to the context out of which they evolve.
   Art that quotes functionality appears modern, architecture that uses
   decoration appears postmodern. In Frances Stark's literature, the
   spaces of literary and scientific writing are drawn together and yet
   come to mean the opposite of each other.
