The Stigma of Being a Housewife

   STOCKHOLM — When the Swedish journalist Peter Letmark tried to track
   down a housewife for a series on 21stcentury parents in the newspaper
   Dagens Nyheter recently, he failed.

   “Housewives,” he explained, “are a nearextinct species in Sweden. And
   the few who still do exist don’t really dare to go public with it.”

   In neighboring Norway, the Housewives’ Association changed its name to
   the Women and Family Association as its membership plummeted to 5,000
   from 60,000. “The reference to housewife was just too embarrassing,”
   said the feminist economist Charlotte Koren of the Norwegian Institute
   of Social Research, a former member and mother of two.

   When it is no longer socially acceptable to be a housewife — or
   homemaker, in modern American parlance — has feminism overshot its
   objective?

   under 3 are scarce. Yet in this generation of young mothers you are
   more likely to find women saying they are on extended maternity leave
   or between jobs than admitting they are housewives.

   Only among the wealthy is it seen as class status when the highly


   “It’s hard to find a balance between not romanticizing and not
   stigmatizing housewives,” said Nancy Folbre, a professor of economics
   at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. “Even though a number of
   women still stay at home, a cultural shift has put them on the

   social norms work:  put pressure on people to conform.”

   In Sweden the demise of the housewife is striking. Fathers share
   parental leave, kindergartens are heavily subsidized, and the universal
   breadwinner model is quite deeply entrenched — from the workplace to

   consultant at The Brand Union, a Swedish brandign company. From
   time to time international ads have to be redubbed to remove offensive
   mentions of a “housewife,” he said. Mr. Andersson and his colleagues
   focus on what he calls the “women short of time” segment.



   Jorun Lindell, a mother of three and the wife of a Swedish
   entrepreneur, tried being a housewife and could not make it work.
   “Sneered at,” she said, for her conviction that her children should
   have their mother at home, she learned that she also could not put them

   Some measures, like the home care allowance Sweden and Norway pay
   stayathome parents who opt out of the day care system, have often
   only reinforced the stigma attached to housewives: concerns that this
   allowance, popular with workingclass and immigrant families, hampers
   social mobility by keeping children of poor and foreign backgrounds out


   A cheaper and possibly more effective way might be to finally and
   formally recognize the contribution housewives make to the economy,
   said Hélène Périvier, an economist at the Institut d’Études Politiques
   in Paris.

   “It’s not about being paid,” said Ms. Périvier, noting that the
   economic value housewives create remains within their home, “it’s about
   being valued.”

The Housewife: An Unjustified Financial Burden on the Community*

   Published online by Cambridge University Press:  20 January 2009

   corresponds to an outofdate concept of marriage and has no
   justification from either the economic or the social standpoint. A
   housewife receives an income from her marriage and, if she actually
   does the housework, she improves the couple's standard of living. A
   number of working hypotheses are put forward in an attempt to see how
   the housewife could assume the normal responsibilities of a taxpayer
   and social security contributor.

   It is impossible (a) to assess the value of the services provided by
   the housewife in her sheltered environment and (b) even to know for
   certain what she really does there (many housewives employ charwomen or
   au pair girls or even fulltime servants). However, when it is a
   question of granting to a widow an income related to what she had when

   this principle is valid with respect to benefits, it ought also to be
   valid with respect to obligations. Thus, the main proposal made here is
   that the housewife should pay income tax and social security
   contributions on a fictitious amount equivalent to half of her
   husband's earnings; this amount would be treated as ‘earned income’,

   contributions on the whole of his own earned income, as he would if he
   employed a housekeeper. The abovementioned fictitious amount would
   also serve as the basis of calculation of the housewife's entitlement
   to social security benefits, subject to redistribution so as to assure
   a minimum subsistence in case of need. Reforms along these lines could

How To Be A Good Housewife In The Modern Era

   Updated October 10, 2022 by ReGain Editorial Team

   The term housewife has come to have a negative connotation in the 21st
   century. The origin of housewife duty is actually a byproduct of the
   Industrial Revolution when people moved out of agrarian societies and
   into modern cities and women faced new roles in society. With this new
   modern lifestyle, the definition of housewife came about: a woman who
   stays home and tends the children and house while her husband works in
   an industrybased job for forty or more hours a week. Whether they go
   by the name of housewife homemaker or stayathome mom, the housewife
   definition has certainly changed over the past century or so.

   Whether this is a result of less than accurate reality television, the
   prominence of feminism in current times, or some other idealization
   that being a housewife is no longer relevant, it is a job that has the
   opposite stigma than it did in the past. Women in the 1930s were
   expected to be housewives  the idea of women who work outside the home
   was frowned upon.  were expected to prioritize their home and
   family over everything else, especially a career. However, now that it
   is 2020, not only had the role of a housewife gone away nearly
   completely, but it has started to make a comeback.

   While housewives or stay at home mothers are becoming common again, it
   is not the same situation as women who lived back in the early to
   mid1900s. The differences between the two will shine some light on how
   to be a good housewife in the modern era. It will also allow you to set
   some expectations for yourself and your marriage, so that knowing who
   is supposed to be doing which tasks does not become a marital concern.

   to avoid issues in your relationship early on.

Expectations Of A Housewife

   You might be wondering how different the duties of a modern era
   housewife might be from the role of housewife in the past. How much
   could the everyday tasks within the home change  cooking and cleaning,
   keeping the children entertained, and other domestic duties seem to be

   presence, you might have seen how different those tasks can be when the
   excerpt from a 1950s home economics textbook made its rounds online.
   The domestic duties of a housewife and mother outlined in the textbook
   were enough to make most women roll their eyes. Whether they go by the
   name of housewife homemaker or stayathome mom, taking care of the
   house and children was always the number one priority.

   By understanding what it takes to be a modern house wife, you will get
   a grasp on some of what previous women experienced in the role.
   However, some of the traditional housewife tasks have changed with the
   times. Identifying those changes might help to make you a quality
   housewife in the 21st century. It will also help you to decide the kind
   of housewife youire to be.

   Clean The House

   While the man is holding a fulltime job outside of the house, the
   woman is holding a fulltime job within the house. This means that a
   housewife is responsible for laundry, dusting, vacuuming, sweeping the
   floors, doing the dishes, not to mention cooking and cleaning up any
   clutter or toys left around the house. While it depends on the specific
   household, many housewives do some of these tasks daily (such as
   laundry) and others weekly (like dusting).

   A recent study shows that, on average, women spend 17 hours a
   week doing housework. This changes housewife housewife. A married woman
   with more than three children typically spends 28 hours a week
   accomplishing the same tasks. More kids mean more laundry, dishes, and
   messes in general, so a mother to several children will stay far busier
   as a stay at home mother and housewife. So, depending on housewares
   housewarming housewife, the work load and the time spent to take care
   of the house changes from home to home. With the baby boomer generation
   being born in the late 1940s to early 1960s, many households had more

   It would be logical to think that modern technology has helped to cut
   down on those many hours of housework needed to tend house. The
   housewives of the past – traditional housewives – did not have robot
   vacuums, dishwashers, or high capacity washing machines. While the
   innovations used in the modern era have saved time and energy for

   Serving Meals

   Like past housewives, modernday housewives are usually responsible for
   meals. Having homemade meals together is something that can really make
   a house a home. While there are some services available today that were
   not available years ago to a family and society, like meal subscription
   boxes, it is still up to the housewife to cook the food. How does this
   differ from housewives in the past? Meal planning in the 21st century
   has become a whole other entity. There were far fewer options in the
   past, and the cost of healthy food was far less, even considering the
   increase in wages and the cost of living overall.

   Because of the cost of healthy options, many housewives are forced to
   pick and choose between cost and quality. This might mean making one or
   two low costs, unhealthy meals for the week and a handful of pricier
   but healthier meals. With the planning involved in the modern era, most
   housewives spend far more time preparing for meals than they did in
   previous years.


   before going grocery shopping. This way, she can control the grocery
   budget and be fully prepared to cook the meals throughout the week. By
   doing this, a housewife will also have the ability to estimate the time
   needed to prepare dinner, thus allowing her to create the most
   productive schedule. A schedule is a key aspect of maintaining the home
   and other domestic duties of being a housewife. After all, every good
   wife knows that preparing good food for her husband and family is a
   great way to show love!

   Taking Care Of The Kids

   No matter the era, a housewife is responsible for taking care of the
   children. While Dad is at work, a stay at home mother must care for her
   kids. Often, when men talk about what they want in a good wife, looking

   ensuring that they are fed, bathed, teeth and hair have been brushed,
   they are dressed, and they have structured activities throughout the
   day. Although some housewives of the 21st century fall into the trap
   of plopping their children in front of the television, a good homemaker
   will organize a variety of activities and play dates with other
   children.

   When the children are schoolaged, a housewife is typically responsible
   for making lunches and ensuring that they are prepared for school,
   extracurriculars, and taking them to and picking them up from school or
   their activities. A dictionary housewife also often requires that mom
   play the role of guidance counselor or therapist.

   Although housewives were responsible for keeping children away from Dad
   in the past so that he could relax after work, parenting in the modern
   era is much more of a team effort. Today's housewife communicates with
   her husband and does not do the parenting alone. Although her husband
   might be tired from a long day at work, a good fulltime housewife will
   also be tired from a long day of caring for the house and kids.

   Spend One On One Time With Your Husband

   A big difference between previous housewives and today's housewives is
   the interaction that occurs between husband and wife. The 1950s home
   economics textbook that was previously mentioned instructs future
   housewives to allow their husbands to relax in the bedroom and let him
   have quiet time when he returns home from work. It also says that the
   wife should not pile her problems on him, as he should be able to
   unload his problems on you. While this was way back in 1950, being a
   housewife has changed dramatically in this area.

   Married couples in the modern era tend to do better with more

   his wife about his problems and concerns, a wife should be able to do
   the same with her husband. By ensuring that communication between man
   and wife is open and honest, being a fulltime housewife is a role that
   is more appreciated by both parties.

   When the focus is placed solely on one person in the relationship, the
   relationship can easily become onesided. However, by being a housewife
   in the modern era, men are more enlightened in how much work their stay
   at home wives do.

   Being A Good Housewife In Today's World

   Times have changed. For a while, that meant being a housewife was
   uncommon. Those that were housewives were looked down upon.
   Fortunately, it is becoming a far better situation for mothers to stay
   at home with their children or wives to stay at home to keep up with
   the house. With the cost of daycare these days, it is the best option
   for many families. If you find yourself being a housewife in the modern
   era, following the abovementioned suggestions will make you a good
   one!

   Remember, being a good housewife in this century means keeping the
   house clean, the kids fed and entertained, making wellrounded meals,
   and maintaining a relationship with your spouse. By placing proper
   emphasis on each of these categories, a fulltime housewife is sure to
   succeed in her journey in the home. If you feel as though reverting to
   the 1950 standards of a housewife would better work for you and your
   relationship, that is okay, too. Find a structure that works for you
   and stick with it!

   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

   kit to stitch up any worn and torn materials in the house. This image

   used. Just be aware that some people may take offense to the diction.

   Who Is Happier, A Housewife Or Working Wife?

   According to a survey, the role of housewife is favored more than a
   career woman who must work outside the home. While many people may

   housewife does not provide an income. That being said, a woman faced

   family, and raising your children, then being a housewife would be

   make an income, and insert oneself into a career, then being a career

   The only important thing is that you do not make decisions based on
   outside pressure. That might be outside pressure from a partner, a job,
   or even your girlfriends. If you want to be a housewife, be a
   housewife! If you want to be a career woman, go for it! Just never let
   anyone make you feel inferior for your decisions.

    tasks may include the basics like cooking for the family,
   cleaning the house, gardening, maintaining the lawn, taking care of the

   chaperone/supervisor, taking care of older parents who may live in or

   A housewife can basically do whatever she needs to do to run a clean,
   smooth, functioning, and prosperous family and household. This may

   Labor that is typically completed by women, especially in the home,

   assumed that women could not and should not be involved in social,
   political, economic, etc. types of business because of their lack of
   knowledge and engagement in society. Now, housewives may still be
   undervalued because of their lack of income or adherence to historical

   multiple schedules other than her own.

   Generally, she must maintain her children’s schedules be them
   schoolrelated, sportsrelated, and/or sociallyrelated. A housewife
   must also maintain her husband’s schedule, ensuring that dinner is
   cooked upon his return home from work and even joining or bringing him
   lunch during his lunch hour. Though a housewife’scription does not
   technically involve these errands, a housewife and family woman may
   also need to take parents/relatives to doctor appointments or run with
   them for their own household errands if they need assistance.

   acceptable as long as you are happy with your role choice.

   How Can I Be The Perfect Housewife?

   There is no standard for being the perfect housewife. At the end of the
   day, you will need to practice plenty in order to ensure everything
   that your household needs and complete that to the degree you believe
   is best. The modern English translation of being a housewife does not
   mean that you cannot be an active community member or figure in
   society. If you are able to run your house well and efficiently, then

   The stigma of a housewife

   Read on to find out why this term is being seen as an insult and evokes

   Over the years, the divide between generations has only grown and that
   probably will explain why the older lot is at sea when the younger
   generation (especially married women) abhor the term ‘housewife’.
   Housewife v/s homemaker: While there is nothing wrong with the word per
   se, it’s what that term has come to represent; that women have a
   problem with says clinical psychologist Dr Seema Hingorrany. She says,
   “Our facets of personality are shaped by conditioning since childhood.
   It is called ‘learned behaviour’. One of the thought processes
   conditioned within us is that housewives don’t have their own identity
   and are always dependent on their spouses, financially and
   emotionally.”

   The housewifeserial connection A housewife is generally portrayed as a
   woman who is unsatisfied with her being or is watching soap operas all
   day. This concept is based on the premise that since a housewife does
   not go out of the house to earn an income, even if she has the
   qualifications to do so, then she must be indolent. This becomes even
   more glaring when she always has to ask her spouse for finances so she
   can run the house. Women don’t like to be called housewives because
   they feel it is a label of being inferior visavis women who are
   working.

   Clinical psychologist and psychotherapist, Varkha Chulani, claims it’s
   linguistics at play, and they are vital for our emotional wellbeing.
   She adds, person who is a housewife is ‘just’ that — a housewife.
   The meaning often attributed to that term is a person who doesn’t do
   much! A homemaker on the other hand is looked upon as person, who

   able to do much more than that. When I got married, I took a break from
   work for a while. And wherever I went I was asked about what I do. The
   term ‘housewife’ would get different reactions. While some would look
   at me with disdain others did probe further to find out if I was simply
   lazy or had no ambition in life. The term itself has now got a negative


   Seema adds, “My client Roma (name changed) refers to this as the
   housewife stigma because the termcribes what a woman traditionally
   did within the four walls of her house. This includes cooking, cleaning
   and taking care of kids), which is not really valued by society. She
   feels that homemaker is a sophisticated word, and does imply that wives
   are not just sitting doing nothing but are fulfiling many domestic
   responsibilities. Most housewives are undervalued by their partners and
   by society at large. We forget that even though they are not being
   paid, the job they do cannot be quantified.”

‘Tradwives’: the new trend for submissive women has a dark heart and history

   A certain kind of housewife has found social media and is airing the
   details of their fight with feminism. But maybe they should tone it
   down a notch

   A thrilling new trend has emerged, and it’s as seismic as the New Look
   was in 40s fashion, or the emergence of Mediterranean cooking in 90s
   Britain: it’s called being a housewife.

   Now you might think: “Ummm, that doesn’t sound THAT new to me.” But all
   fashion trends are rehashes, and “tradwife”, as this one is dubbed, is
   housewife with a social media spin. It’s like bringing back 90s style,
   but swapping that brown eyeliner for contouring makeup. It’s just so
   much more zeitgeist, you see?

   should submit to their husband and focus on making as many white babies
   as possible. British tradwives insist this has nothing to do with them:
   “Someone even said, this type of housewife was promoted by the Third
   Reich. And it’s like: ‘Really?! I didn’t even know that!’” Pettitt told
   the BBC, sitting underneath her union jack bunting, musing about how
   “we don’t even know the identity of our country right now”.

   Now look, clearly being a happy housewife does not mean you are a Nazi.
   But also, maybe it’s time to dial down a notch, tradwives, for your own
   sake? After all, if you’re constantly posting videos to YouTube about

Why "Housewife" Should Not Be A Dirty Word

   As the daughter of a fulltime mom, the word “housewife” elicits mixed
   feelings. On the one hand, as a Latina feminist, I am aware of how our
   patriarchal society governs women's roles and relegates them to

   that supports her household — and can't help but admire and appreciate
   her work ethic. I was offended and even a bit hurt, therefore, to learn
   that Dictionary.com defines "housewife" as a term that is “sometimes
   offensive."

   To be fair, thisignation perhaps makes sense based on the
   relatively recent historical legacy established by the feminist
   movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Being a housewife was largely regarded
   by this movement as equitable to giving up one's power and, in a sense,
   being coerced into doing domestic work. Feminist leaders — like Betty

   this idea and proposed that women must reject domesticity by breaking
   professional barriers and claiming personal, sexual freedom. Rejecting
   the "housewife" role was part and parcel of this effort.

   The current, negative connotation of the term "housewife," therefore,
   is likely tied to this perception that domestic work was inherently
   oppressive. It's true that for decades many women had no choice but to
   be housewives and it makes sense that being perpetually confined to one
   role would make anyone hate any occupation, no matter it's nature.
   What's more, many women at the time likely did hate being housewives
   and wanted something else from life.

   But the idea that being a housewife is somehow less worthy of respect
   has carried on to our generation,pite the fact that many women do
   have other options now. Maintaining this belief therefore fails to take
   into account (and actively discredits) the women who genuinely enjoy
   housework. It also devalues all the work that does go into being a
   "housewife." According to a 2014 survey by Salary.com, for example, the
   average stayathome mom would have made $188,905 in 2014 including
   56.5 hours in overtime. Working moms, according to the same survey,

   outside the home.

   Clearly, being a housewife is not an easy job anderves respect. Now
   that women have many opportunities available to them, being a housewife
   is often a choice rather than a role necessitated by coercion or a lack
   of other opportunities. An interest in domesticity shouldn't make a

What kind of woman are you: A housewife or a career woman?

Why do women leave their children and go to work? Some women decide to work


   February 12, 2015
   What kind of woman are you: A housewife or a career woman?
   Follow Saudigazette on Google News Account


   many ways. To begin with, having a working mother in the family will
   help the family financially. A working woman has her own career
   aspirations and her own set of responsibilities. But for a housewife,
   life starts and ends with her husband, children and her own family

   There are both advantages and disadvantages to being a working woman
   just as there are to being a housewife. Working women have to leave
   their children in the care of a housemaid or someone else. However, you
   cannot trust housemaids, as they cannot give the care which only a
   mother can give.

   I asked a few women about how they feel about being a housewife or a
   working woman in Saudi Arabia. Their opinions are as follows:

   Ayesha, an Indian housewife, said: “I am an educated housewife. After
   returning from school, my  children are very happy when they find me at
   home.  have so much to talk about.  A housewife can help her
   children with their homework, and who says that housewives are not
   contributing to the family financially?  save the cost of a
   housemaid and of private tuition as well. This is a major contribution.

   it is to leave your children at home and go to work. I sometimes wish I
   could stay home but that is not possible because I want to give my
   child a better life and a better education. Housewives also contribute
   a lot to their family. It’s not an easy task to sacrifice your career
   and stay home to cook and look after your children. I feel that working

   her husband and children 24 hours a day does not mean that a woman is
   the perfect mother.  A working woman understands the value of work.
   Unlike a housewife, she never blames her husband for being late from
   the office. Working women often find some fulfillment in their jobs,
   apart from home. Hence, they may have better life satisfaction and feel


   Jabida, an Indian, said: “I want to say that I disagree with the idea
   that housewives are less educated. I have worked when I needed to.
   Right now I can stay at home and I love it. I teach my daughter the
   alphabet, numbers, colors, shapes, etc. We go outside and do various

   does lead to fulfillment.  And with changing times, a lady can also
   work from home, part time, or with flexible hours.  So let her choose
   whether she wants to have a career or wants to be a housewife.”

   So to conclude, I would like to share the example of Hazrat Khadija


   A woman in Islam is given financial security. Many women still tend to
   be housewives in Saudi Arabia, while others want to work for their own
   reasons. I think both of these choices are acceptable. It depends on
   your own attitude toward life.

Why Is Housewife a Bad Word?

   And why do we need to use it?


   I know I’m walking a dangerous path with his article and risk being

Infinities of being a housewife

Why her ‘job’ is perhaps the most magnanimous one in the world

   you want to be when you grow up?” She put on a pensive face as she
   mulled over the question. Finally, her eyes brightened as she pointed a
   finger at her mother and squealed, housewife!”

   For a moment, every soul listening to that seemingly innocuous exchange
   was stunned into silence, which was broken only by the guttural
   laughter of my aunt’s fatherinlaw, my cousin’s paternal grandfather.
   “Sweet child! That’s not a profession. The job of a housewife is hardly
   a job. It’s a duty.”


   deny the fact that a majority of Indian women still do not go out to
   work. Instead, they work at home. Not from home as entrepreneurs or
   freelancers, but rather in their houses, as housewives.

   At the core of every family, nuclear or joint, is the housewife. The
   importance of her physical presence is underscored by the stasis the
   household comes to when she is not around. She singlehandedly runs it,


   There is hardly any difference between the ‘job’cription of a
   housewife and that of the chief executive officer of a company. While
   the CEO steers a company forward, the housewife is at the helm of the
   household. The CEO may work 12 hours a day, taking important decisions
   in the field of production, sales, finance and human resources. The
   housewife is just as able an administrator. She, in fact, works
   roundtheclock. She also deals with physical, financial and human
   resources. Her decisions affect the lives of people and the wellbeing

   seems like a ridiculous idea.

   The patriarchal understanding of the role of a housewife is that her
   job is a duty. She has to perform these tasks on a daily basis,
   irrespective of whether she likes it or wants to do it at all. Her job

   interpretation of this metaphor, our male chauvinistic society has
   failed to realise that while the man may bring home the bread, it is
   the woman, or the housewife, who actually makes the food that he eats
   out of that bread.

   A housewife wants nothing more than to be treated with love, respect,
   gratefulness and dignity. Her ‘job’ is perhaps the most magnanimous one
   in the world. It’s time society woke up to her domestic significance,

   COMMENTARY
   Politicizing the Housewife
   November 1, 2001
   By Wendy McElroy

   What it means to be a housewife is being revised ideologically in order
   to impugn the choice some mothers make to stay at home.


   issue, Playing God on No Sleep, the Pulitzerprizewinning Anna
   Quindlen argued that every mother secretly identified with killing her
   own children. Shecribed the typical stayathome housewife this
   way: Shes tired, shes hot and shes been up all night throwing
   sheets into the washer because the smaller of her two boys has

   potential, the next leap of logic is easy. Murdering moms are driven to
   violence by the men who impregnate them and trap them in the
   psychologically devastating role of housewife. Thus many voices in the
   media blame Andrea Yatess husbanda man whom no one has suggested was
   ever violenteven while they express sympathy for Andrea herself. 

Friedan Called into Question

   Interestingly, the current debate about housewifery comes at the same
   time as the validity of the book that sparked the original debate is
   being severely questioned. In 1963 Betty Friedans book The Feminine
   Mystique, spoke of the problem that has no name. Stated simply,
   domesticity denied housewives their humanity and potential, making them
   suffer both physically and mentally. Friedancribed the typical 50s
   family as a comfortable concentration camp. Like camp inmates,
   suburban housewives had adjusted psychologically and become dependent,
   passive, childlike and lived at a lower human level.


   during which women flooded out of the home into the university and the
   workplace. As women continued to read Friedans book, the idea of
   housewifery as a pathology was cemented to feminism.

   Recent works have thoroughly discredited Friedans arguments, the power

   and the Making of the Feminine Mystique (1998), Daniel Horowitz
   explored Friedans background and debunked the myth that she ever
   represented the typical suburban housewife as she has persistently
   claimed. Friedan had been a staunch political activist on the communist
   left for decades before her first book appeared. Horowitzs analysis is


   The fact that readers of Friedans book identified with her as a
   sisterhousewife who had naïvely bought into the domesticity myth was
   one reason for The Feminine Mystiques huge success. The same
   readership would never have identified with the real Friedan: a

   subset of the New Left.

   In addition to questions about Friedans credentials as a housewife,
   grave doubt has been cast both on her interpretation of the experts on
   which The Feminine Mystique was based and the facts presented by the

   Without the backing of solid statistics and research, Friedans work
   does nothing more than offer anecdotal evidence of the unhappiness of
   some housewives and then proceeds to define the reality of most on that
   basis.


  pite the criticism, however, it is undeniably true that The Feminine
   Mystique spoke to many women whose lives were changed as a result of
   reading the book. For them, being a housewife was a negation of their
   potential as human beings, and they discovered the courage to reach out
   to make a different choice. But voices within feminism were not content
   to view domesticity simply as a choice that appealed to some women and
   not to others. So a new political mythology of housewifery was born.

The Myth of the Housewife

   In the 60s the mainstream of feminism was liberal and contained a

   do with motherhood.

   A new theory of the housewife was evolving in which the role had the
   political status of chattel. To gender feminists, marriage and the
   family became inextricably bound up with private property, the class

   relegated to the roles of breeding, maintaining men, and buying
   consumer goods. Mothers provided the next and appropriately
   indoctrinated generation of laborers for the capitalists; housewives
   maintained the male workforce by cleaning and cooking; housekeepers
   enriched the capitalist structure by consuming the products it

   Thrown into this economic condemnation of housework and the traditional
   family as bastions of capitalism are other accusations. For example,
   housewives are said to be kept in an isolation that encourages domestic
   violence.


   victimhood, which has gone unrecognized by society at large.

A New/Old View of Housewifery

   Fortunately, voices of sanity remain. One of them belongs to Mimi

   Individualist feminism views staying at home to raise a family as a
   choice every bit as valid as entering the work force. Gladsteins essay
   begins, We dont hire housewives, because that is the response she
   received when she asked about joining the faculty of the University of
   Texas at El Paso, where she is now associate dean of liberal arts.
   Gladstein refused to be devalued as a human being because she was a
   housewife. That jobno less than teaching university
   Englishexpressed her worth and her competence. Even more, being a
   housewife was the training ground where she learned skills such as
   setting priorities and budgeting time. Gladstein writes, All I really
   needed to know about chairing a department, I learned by being a Jewish
   Mother.

   Gladsteincribes how being a suburban housewife trained her to
   handle taking over as executive director of her universitys Diamond
   Jubilee celebration. She writes, That job allowed me to use my
   housewifery skills to create and manage events as diverse as football
   halftimes, citywide street festivals, physics fairs, student
   retention programs, Vietnam Memorial dedications, city and university

   Lawyers may be able to use these judgments to "trigger developments in
   constitutional law and family laws to recognise the unpaid work of
   housewives in normal times, rather than only at times of disruption",
   Prof Kotiswaran says. Paying wages to women doing unpaid work at home
   would also boost India's declining female labour participation rate.

Unpacking ‘Housewife’ And Its Problematic Implications

   Housewife as a word is complicit in the erasure of agency of married
   women by defining them in terms of their relationships and the domestic
   obligations that correspond.

   In order to unpack why ‘housewife’ is a problematic word, the idea of
   ‘work’ must be problematised. One of the key ideas that capitalism
   tries to sell is the equation of financial capital with agency. What is

   Traditionally, masculine jobs are paid for and have hence been defined
   over time as ‘work’ as per a capitalist definition which incorporates
   income and profit into its logics. To then use the word housewife for
   women who don’t “work”, therefore, is to not only leave the idea of
   work unproblematised, it is also actively playing into a capitalist


   It is also not gender neutral, as unpaid labour in the home as the
   domain of the work that housewives do is specific to women; with its
   association with femininity, men escape the devaluation and therefore
   do not have a commonly used counterpart to the word housewife. The word
   when used for women ties in capitalist exploitation with patriarchal
   subordination to create an identity which does not allow for thinking
   about these women as having agency of their own.

     When being a ‘housewife’ is associated with “not working,” the
     importance of domestic labour in sustaining capitalism is swept

World Mental Health Day 2022: Working woman vs housewife; is one more
stressed than the other? Experts answer


   Updated on Oct 10, 2022 09:14 AM IST

World Mental Health Day 2022: Be it a working woman or a housewife, the daily
duties seem to be neverending for females  from taking care of kitchen,
children, elderly to their individual goals.

   almost here and it is the perfect time to talk about mental health of
   women who often juggle with multiple responsibilities. Be it a working
   woman or a housewife, the daily duties seem to be neverending for
   females  from taking care of kitchen, children, elderly to their
   individual goals. This puts them at an increased risk of depression,

   A survey conducted by Researchgate which saw participation of 80
   married women in the age ranging from 2540 years, including 40 married
   working women and 40 housewives, noted that while working women
   experience financial independence, high selfesteem the house wife may
   experience insecurity and poor social life etc. The survey concluded
   that married working women and the housewives have their own set of
   issues which may cause difference in their quality of life. On the
   occasion of World Mental Health Day, we asked mental health experts
   about the unique challenges of working woman and a housewife and also
   if one is more stressed than the other.


   Psychiatry, Paras Hospitals, Gurugram.

What ails the mental health of a housewife

   "Housewives spend their entire time dedicated to routine chores but
   that is not the case with working women and hence they are good at
   grooming and taking care of themselves," says Dr Jiloha.

   allows women to make decisions, be independent and wake up to be
   confident every single day. None of these scenarios is met with a
   housewife and that somehow gives them time and space to welcome a
   plethora of negative thoughts. At work, you tend to be practical and
   take opinions about solving problems. But it is an upsidedown episode
   when you stay at home. Society looks at a housewife’s chores as if it
   is her duty and why should there be rewards? No one appreciates it.
   Hence, there is a lot of dissatisfaction and anxiety. A working woman
   has no time to think of disappointments," says Dr Jiloha.

   "In various households, the housewives fell prey to the frustrations
   and aggression of their male counterparts. There is a perpetual burden
   of keeping the family tied up together along with bearing the financial
   issues and still keeping the family happy together by taking care of
   all the members of the family – husbands as well as the inlaws was a
   very challenging task for housewives. There is also a rising tension of
   sexual dissatisfaction between husband and wife. According to a
   research in this area, 70% Indian women do not have orgasm during


   Dr Kapoor says some of common triggers of mental health problems in
   housewives are episodes of depression and anxiety, marital
   dissatisfaction, domestic violence and patriarchal ideologies.


   and the burnout is excessive to drain her mentally," says Dr Jiloha.

   Working women vs housewives: who is more stressed?

   "Both have their own set of pros and cons but a working woman is more

   need to have a certain profession.

   "We cannot say that only working women or housewives are stressed.
   Stress can stem from anything or anybody around you," she says.

What's so bad about being a housewife?

   After reading a recent study that suggests women would rather be
   divorced than doing dishes, Jennifer defends the “traditional” role of
   housewives.

   Jennifer Pinarski February 11, 2013


   When I’m in the mood for snark and irreverence, Jezebel never
   disappoints. This week, housewives were under fire with the headline
   “Most Women Would Rather Kick Their Husbands to the Curb Than Be a
   Housewife” catching my attention.

   Highlighting research from Kathleen Gerson’s 2009 book, The Unfinished

   this choice and mine could not.

   There are moments in my new life as a housewife that my 20yearold
   careerminded self would have cringed at, but now, as a stayathome
   parent who does most of the cooking and cleaning, I can say confidently
   that divorce is not the option I would choose. But if the misconception
   that a housewife’s role in a marriage is little more than cooking the

   Housewife 'would be paid £30,000'

   Clothes Pegs
   Nearly threequarters of those polled said it was a fulltime job

   Housewives would be paid more than the average worker if they received
   the going rate for their household chores, a survey has suggested.

   A poll of 4,000 housewives for networking website alljoinon.com
   suggested that the average mum worked for nearly nine hours a day every
   day.

   The website said a housewife would earn almost £30,000 a year if she
   was employed to do all the same errands.


   home was a fulltime job.

   "The survey clearly demonstrates that not only do housewiveserve a
   wage for their efforts, they also need a break from the daily grind,"
   said Carolyn Morris, spokeswoman for alljoinon.com.


   Fourteen minutes making the beds is worth £1.29 for a chambermaid, and
   a kitchen assistant would be paid £2.57 for a housewife's typical 28
   minutes of washing up.

   halfamillion mentions on Instagram.



   While they may be reaping the benefits when it comes to their family
   life, this new breed of millennial housewife can find themselves

'R54 800 per month': Kenyan judge declares that being a housewife is a
fulltime job worthy of compensation


   do..."

   A Kenyan high court judge has declared that being a housewife is a
   fulltime job, and it should therefore attract some form of
   compensation.

   While presiding over a matrimonial dispute, Teresia Matheka, who is a
   Kenyan High Court Judge, said that it is unfair for courts to deny the
   contribution that housewives provide to the financial progress of the
   household.

   Though the exact details pertaining to the financial remuneration have
   not been officially finalised, the High Court ruled on 24 September
   2021 that a housewife should be paid a salary every month.

   Judge Matheka maintained that the services provided by a housewife
   should be considered work, as those tasks would otherwise be outsourced
   and paid for and stated that it would be unfair to constitute only


   In addition to considering the value of the services rendered by a
   housewife, Judge Matheka urged her counterparts to consider the nine
   months of pregnancy when presiding over matrimonial matters, as she
   believes that pregnancy is equivalent to working, given that surrogates


   On a Kenyan radio station, Kiss FM, presenter Kamene Goro weighed in on
   the matter on her morning show, stating that Kenyan housewiveserve
   no less than 400 000 Kenyan shillings as monthly compensation. This
   equates to approximately R54 800 per month.

Whatever happened to the housewife?

   It started 40 years ago, when a letter to this paper led to a register


   Local groups formed and a few years later acquired the name the
   National Housewives' Register. In the absence of a personal income,
   early members admit fiddling the housekeeping to raise the small
   membership fee. Today most groups meet every other week to discuss

   this generation of women is by no means rushing to join. NWR may be
   celebrating its ruby anniversary but will an organisation born to
   alleviate the lot of the housewife survive to drink to its golden when,
   politically and personally, she is apparently dead and buried? Imagine
   the outcry if Tony Blair made an example of the housewife's foresight
   in the way Margaret Thatcher once did. The title has been banished to
   the social history archives and now rears its head only in the

   questionnaires.

   The spic 'n' span 50s feather duster image of the British housewife
   went out with Hilda Ogden and Ken Dodd. Instead, the debate about women
   and domesticity has evolved into an anxiety not about keeping house but
   about bringing up children. So whereas it was better for "him" for a
   woman to stay at home, the argument now is it's best for the kids. The
   observation Jerman made about the mental "payoff' a housewife makes
   still has echoes. What's best for the children may not be what's best
   for the modern woman. The lack of status implied by the prefix "just" a
   housewife has not died with the term but now attaches itself to the
   word mother.

   "Working mother" now rolls off the tongue with the ease with which
   "housewife" once did.  women no longer go into voluntary exile if
   they marry or have children but, argues Mary Dodkins, NWR's marketing
   coordinator, there is still a need for a space where you are not

   school. Now 64, she notes that members have "partners" as well as
   husbands and many are divorced, widowed or remarried. Her life goes
   some way to explaining how, just as the term "housewife" has been made
   redundant by social forces, so it was also created by them. Reymond had

   children and many other such jobs, is called a nonworking woman or

   Can we call a lady drawing a monthly salary a working woman and the one

   choosing a woman as a wife, one of the most important is whether to
   marry a working woman or a stayathome housewife. His own choice, the
   wish of his parents and the opinion of his close friends or colleagues
   directly have an impact on his final decision about marrying a working

   It can be undoubtedly said that the rising inflation and the

Stigma of being a housewife

   Fatima Dabeer


   With the revolutionary growth of feminism and woman coming out as bold
   and strong, the importance of housewives is deteriorating. Where all
   the women are talking about coming out of the comforts of their homes
   to compete with men in all fields of life, no one talks about the
   efforts of housewives. In the past, women were expected to stay home
   and run all the household errands, and those who wanted to work were
   often stigmatised. However, now in the modern world, it is the other

   The word has now got a negative connotation and is often associated
   with women who don’t want to work and would rather live off their
   partner. Most housewives are undervalued by their partners and by
   society at large. Across the world, women who stay home are now known
   to be old fashioned and an economic burden to the society. Their daily

   the areas of interior decorations, domestic spending and children’s
   clothes; all considered to be insignificant. Marjorie L Devault talks
   about the invisible work done by the housewives; how they are concerned
   about every family member’s food preferences, their health and
   organizing the family to come together. In all these they lose their
   own preferences,ire, luxury time and relaxing hours. Jean Duncombe
   in her study found out that majority of the housewives are playing a
   major part in holding their relationships together by doing the crucial
   and tiring emotional work. It puts an emotional strain on them but it


   Various celebrities and writers have presented their perspective on
   being a housewife. Annie Dillard says: “I’m a housewife: I spend far
   more time on housework than anything else.” Celine Dion claims: “I have
   become a housewife and there is no better job.” Tamara Braxton says: “I
   never want my kids to feel like I’m just some housewife, kicking it
   with my husband, because that’s not the kind of woman I am.” Martha
   Plimpton states: “I’m so sick of hearing how there’s no strong roles
   for women. I don’t care about strong roles. I just want to see women
   who are characters! A nun, a serial killer, a housewife, as long as
   there’s some depth there.”

   Our mothers, sisters and daughters, all those who are housewives act as
   a sponge to soak all the tensions and problems to create our homes a
   safe haven. It is wrong of us to look at the housewives as lazy,
   unaware of the social world and degrading them for the immense amount
   of work they perform from just the four walls of our homes. It is said
   that it is the duty of the man to maintain the financial stability of
   the house, in the same way men and children are dependent on the
   housewives for stability in domestic life, family bonding and mental
   peace.  should be equally credited as a woman doing a job outside

   This article looks at the real lives of women who choose to stay at
   home and be housewives and fulltime mothers

   By Samantha Chapman

   With more women choosing to be stay at home mothers and housewives what
   does this really mean and do stereotypical opinions surrounding it need
   to change?

   they have made the choice not to ‘work’ in a typical sense of the word,
   and most importantly what it really means to be a stay at home
   mam/housewife.

   Stay at home mothers and housewives often face judgement on this choice
   and like every aspect of life face stereotyping especially derived from
   the media.

   Television shows such as ‘The real housewives of...’ has painted an
   image of those who choose to stay at home of one of glamour, where
   wealth and excess are priority and the women have one goal that very

   One Housewife, Lisa Jones from Melbourne Australia, believes being a
   housewife in the 21^st century is decision to put the needs of my
   family first and provide for the household in ways other than
   financial.”

    are three women who chose to stay at home, but all have differing
   views about what is important and what is means to be a stay at home
   mother or housewife. So, with differing opinions what does research

Is TikTok housewives trend encouraging women to be 'submissive'?

   By Samantha Kamman, Christian Post Reporter
   Housewife, baking Getty Images

   A TikTok trend of stayathome moms sharing their daily routine of

   homemakers is part of a trend of American women making “trad wife”
   (traditional wife) content showing the positive aspects of being a
   housewife. The trad wife hashtag has more than 96 million views on
   TikTok, with some users incorporating it into their usernames.



   In an interview with Insider, Williams said she is not disparaging
   women’s right to work, but adds that housewives like her believe many
   “women have drifted far from [our] roots.”


   She went on to insinuate that society’s “gender system” tells women
   that being a homemaker is a lifestyle choice, but it’s really pushing
   them toward the role of a fulltime housewife.

   "It's less of a choice than maybe we think it is,” Janning said.

The Stress of Being a Housewife

   4 minutes
   The Stress of Being a Housewife The Stress of Being a Housewife

   Last update: 27 April, 2020

   We could devote hundreds of pages to the topic of stress itself.
   However, there are some people who are especially susceptible to the
   effects of stress. In this case, we’re talking about housewives.

   We may think that the role of a housewife doesn’t involve pressure
   since it’s a common occupation. However, this isn’t the case.
   Housewives actually do a lot of tasks.

   If we consider intensive work, high level of responsibility, and lack
   of leisure time causes of stress, then being a housewife is definitely
   a stressful occupation. This means that a housewife may be exposed to a
   lot of stressors.

The housewife: a superwoman with superpowers

   The primary responsibility of a housewife is to care for her family and
   her home. Her obligations demand physical and mental stress.
   a stressedout housewife

   Regarding physical stress, it may not be too intense. However, it may
   be continuous, with few breaks, which may lead to faster deterioration.
   Housewives are physically exerted throughout the day.  don’t have
   schedules. From the time they wake up until they go to bed, they have
   to be active in order to fulfill their family’s needs. From personal
   care to nutrition, the housewife takes on all the work. The
   responsibility of caring for a dependent family member rests on the
   mother.

   At the same time, housewives have to maintain order and cleanliness in
   their homes. This activity is neverending because they have to do it
   every day. Moreover, what’s worse is the feeling of being useless

   nothing and then arranging them again tomorrow.

The housewife has to exert continuous physical effort

   The physical effort housewives make tend to be more routinary than
   intensity. However, some people may suppose (and for good reason) that
   they also exert themselves physically.  have to move furniture,
   carry heavy bags, carry a child in their arms…

   It may be true that a housewife has some time to take a break. She can
   sleep throughout the night. But can she really take a break or sleep?
   The housewife must remain alert day or night for any unforeseen
   situation, especially if she has small children who cry, demand things,
   or get sick.

   All this physical exertion leads to fatigue. This fatigue leads to
   muscular fatigue and exhaustion. The stress of being a housewife is
   made up of these factors.

Mental activity results in the stress of being a housewife

   People believe that a housewife’s activities don’t involve mental work.
   However, this isn’t true. She must prepare the menu, calculate
   expenses, solve her children’s problems, etc. She has to face many

   traffic controllers, involve mental exhaustion. However, if we delve
   deeper into this, these professions are no different from being a
   housewife. Both undertake important tasks such as planning, resource
   management, or communicative intelligence.

   On the other hand, mental exertion may lead to mental fatigue. This
   diminishes her capacity for concentration, contributing to emotional
   instability. Therefore, the stress of being a housewife is heightened
   by her exposure to mental exertion.

The housewife also has a life of her own

   A housewife is, first of all, a person. She has her own conflicts,
   feelings, and psychological intricacies. What would happen if the
   housewife suffered from other types of stress, aside from the stress
   that comes from being a housewife?
   mentally exhausted housewife

   We think that nowadays, many housewives, besides carrying the entire
   burden of their homes, also work outside the home. That is, we’re
   talking about people who take on two fulltime jobs, with little or no

   misunderstood.

   Being a housewife is a dull job, who many women who never receive the
   recognition they should, do. This feeling of being unimportant often
   acts as a catalyst for stress, triggering the feeling of loneliness and
   isolation between the walls of the housewife’s home.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Being a Housewife

   The advantages and disadvantages of being a housewife arecribed
   here in this article. Before coming to the advantages and disadvantages
   let us know in detail what housewife means.  A woman who stays at home
   to take care of her home and family is known as housewife. Everyone has
   their unique ideas related to this topic as for someone being housewife
   is a cakewalk and for some other it is difficult to be a housewife. As
   a coin as both sides like that being a housewife has its own advantages
   and disadvantages. Let us get into detail.

Advantages of being a housewife

   The advantages of being a housewife arecribed below in detail:

1. Keeping an eye on children and taking care of home

   children. Due to this they have to depend on other people to take care
   of their kids and home and they cannot keep an eye on what is happening
   in the home. Being a housewife she can closely watch and monitor her
   kids this will increase bonding between the kids and her. Thus she can
   completely enjoy her motherhood by watching her kids growing which is

2. Flexibility

   Housewife has a flexibility to do daily household chores or anything
   else as she wishes to do. There is no particular order in doing her
   works. As there are no deadlines or stress in doing work like job

3. Management of time

   Being a housewife one can utilize their time wisely and use their
   leisure time for increasing her skills. Although she is doing
   everyone’s work in the house she can manage to have her own time which

   things etc.., all these cannot be possible to do for a working woman as
   she has no time to come up with her interests. And while we compare
   housewife and working woman housewife work for almost 56 hours a day
   whereas working woman has to work for 810 hours depending on their job
   nature by this we can say that housewife feel less tired than a working
   woman.

4. Housewife is herself a Boss and maid too

   Housewife has a freedom to do things. For example if she wants to
   rearrange things in her home she can do according to her taste as she
   is her own boss. And at the end of the day she was appreciated for all
   the sacrifice she was doing to the family. Being a housewife is plays
   both the roles of a boss and a maid which give her satisfaction.


5. Family matters most

   For a woman who is housewife for her family matters most. It is
   advantage for the family members as she takes care of everyone in the
   family.  She will be there for everyone in her family. It is a boon for
   some people to have a partner who is housewife. In her point of view
   being a housewife makes her enable to take care of herself too like she
   can take care her skin, hair etc., as she has time to maintain but it
   is not possible to maintain everything careful for a working women like
   a housewife.

Disadvantages of being a housewife

   The disadvantages of being a housewife arecribed below in detail:

1. Service taken for granted

   The work done by a housewife is taken for granted by everyone in the
   house.  There is no appreciation or recognisation of her hard work
   through the day.  Her decision is not taken in financial matters or

2. No financial stability

   There is no financial independence for housewife. For everything she
   has to depend on her husband. This will cause some disturbances and
   upset her. Unlike working woman if she wants to buy anything or wants
   to give gifts to her loved ones or for herself she has to again ask
   money which she feels bad and insecure. And if family is facing some
   serious financial issues housewife cannot able to help them.

3. No Professional Life

   Housewife doesn’t have a Professional life. She may be get bored of
   doing same daily household chores. She is less explored to outer world
   and she may not be able to experience the work life which gives some

   good.  are little things which can give joy and fulfillment of
   life. There is a great life with proper utilization of one’s skills in
   a productive way as the skills of housewife are not getting into
   limelight all her skills will be wasted if she doesn’t concentrate.


5. Psychological imbalances

   As housewife don’t care of herself and she ignores her health and
   changes in physical and mental conditions her body tends to change
   easily. She gains weight. And an idle mind generates many evil thoughts
   which are not good to her. The life of housewife is boring and
   depressing in this point of view.

The changing role of the ‘housewife’

Forty years on from the publication of her landmark book Housewife, ANN
OAKLEY talks to the Morning Star modern feminism and gender roles today



   THIS year marks the 40th anniversary of the publication of Ann Oakley’s
   Housewife.

   Based on Oakley’s PhD research, the pioneering feminist book looks at
   the role of the housewife in modern industrialised society.

   “The study of domestic labour was not taken seriously at all — it

   suburban London. She found they tended to be dissatisfied because of
   the monotony, fragmentation and social isolation inherent in the role
   of housewife.

   Therefore, as “housework is directly opposed to the possibility of
   human selfactualisation,” she concluded with a call to abolish the
   housewife role.

   “I was being deliberately provocative,” she explains about the book’s

   Four decades later, what’s changed?

   “I think the whole notion of women being housewives has changed,” she
   replies.

   “If you asked women now to talk about themselves as housewives they
   wouldn’t know what you were talking about really.”


   person,” she quips.

   Having read Housewife and Oakley’s stupendously good Gender and Planet
   Earth — a book that moves from men and meateating to critiquing
   postmodernism — I can safely say contemporary feminism is missing a

   source of inequality between men and women.

   Housewife could therefore be the key text in the revival of feminist
   concern over housework that must take place if women are to gain any
   semblance of equality in the future.
