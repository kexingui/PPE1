And still exist don’t really dare go public it.” In neighboring Norway, Housewives’ Association changed name Women Family Association membership plummeted 5,000 60,000. “The reference housewife embarrassing,” said feminist economist Charlotte Koren Norwegian Institute Social Research, former member mother two. When longer socially acceptable housewife — homemaker, modern American parlance — feminism overshot objective? In 1950s, women expected stay home, wanted work often stigmatized. Today it’s mostly way round, pitting women one another along fault lines conviction, economic class need, and, often, ethnicity. Across developed world, women stay home increasingly seen old-fashioned economic burden society. If husbands rich, frequently berated lazy; immigrants, keeping children learning language ways host country. Their daily chores cleaning, cooking raising children always ignored national accounts. (If man marries housekeeper stops paying work, G.D.P. goes down. If woman stops nursing buys formula baby, G.D.P. goes up.) In debate counts women catching men education labor market terms raising productivity economic growth, stay-at-home moms valued less ever. This despite fact Norway United States, economists put value unpaid work ahead manufacturing sector. In countries mothers still struggle combine career family quit work less conviction necessity, often doubly punished. In Germany, biggest economy Europe, schools still finish lunchtime, full-time nurseries children 3 scarce. Yet generation young mothers likely find women saying extended maternity leave jobs admitting housewives. Only among wealthy seen class status highly educated mother takes children Chinese violin lessons. “It’s hard find balance romanticizing stigmatizing housewives,” said Nancy Folbre, professor economics University Massachusetts, Amherst. “Even though number women still stay home, cultural shift put defensive.” Bearing mind women work want families need two incomes, said, “That’s way social norms work: They put pressure people conform.” In Sweden demise housewife striking. Fathers share parental leave, kindergartens heavily subsidized, universal breadwinner model quite deeply entrenched — workplace popular culture. Once key market advertisers daytime television, happy homemakers touting cleaning products rarely feature TV ads. They “nonexistent segment,” said Jonas Andersson, brand consultant The Brand Union, Swedish brand design company. From time time international ads re-dubbed remove offensive mentions “housewife,” said. Mr. Andersson colleagues focus calls “women short time” segment. “From chocolate cars, want target working mothers,” said. Nordic politicians long focused working mothers, giving subsidies elderly care child care and, recently, financial incentives share parental leave. Over all, policies increased economic growth, raised tax revenue given women wanted work financial independence, social benefits, personal fulfillment — short, many would call freedom. But social engineering blunt tool, worry freedom working mothers come expense making outcasts minority want things differently. Jorun Lindell, mother three wife Swedish entrepreneur, tried housewife could make work. “Sneered at,” said, conviction children mother home, learned also could put state day care hours every day week reserved families parents either working, looking work studying. She ended enrolling university without interest course, “wasting resources get something taxes already pay for,” said. There easy way right unintended consequences well-meaning policy. Some measures, like home care allowance Sweden Norway pay stay-at-home parents opt day care system, often reinforced stigma attached housewives: concerns allowance, popular working-class immigrant families, hampers social mobility keeping children poor foreign backgrounds socializing day care made controversial. A cheaper possibly effective way might finally formally recognize contribution housewives make economy, said Hélène Périvier, economist Institut d’Études Politiques Paris. “It’s paid,” said Ms. Périvier, noting economic value housewives create remains within home, “it’s valued.” If ever time include unpaid housework care work G.D.P. figures, now, said. Working mothers stake this, too: They still unpaid work homes — even Sweden.

Contrary might thought, system even really designed protect ‘the family’: operates irrespective whether children not. It fact intended reward couple wife devotes looking husband. It quite likely women go work (and also housework) bear share cost this, ‘overpayments’ obliged make taxation social security contributions. I propose system abolished, corresponds out-of-date concept marriage justification either economic social standpoint. A housewife receives income marriage and, actually housework, improves couple's standard living. A number working hypotheses put forward attempt see housewife could assume normal responsibilities taxpayer social security contributor. It impossible (a) assess value services provided housewife sheltered environment (b) even know certain really (many housewives employ charwomen au pair girls even full-time servants). However, question granting widow income related husband alive, entitled specified fraction – usually half – husband received would received. If principle valid respect benefits, ought also valid respect obligations. Thus, main proposal made housewife pay income tax social security contributions fictitious amount equivalent half husband's earnings; amount would treated ‘earned income’, favourable assumption standpoint. At time, husband would pay income tax social security contributions whole earned income, would employed housekeeper. The above-mentioned fictitious amount would also serve basis calculation housewife's entitlement social security benefits, subject redistribution assure minimum subsistence case need. Reforms along lines could put effect gradually, since would unjust penalize people one day next irresponsible behaviour deliberately encouraged adopt present. __________________________________________________________________ Type Articles Information Journal Social Policy , Volume 8 , Issue 1 , January 1979 , pp. 1 - 26 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0047279400008369[Opens new window] Copyright Copyright © Cambridge University Press 1979 Access options Get access full version content using one access options below.

But maybe tone notch Who knew traditional modern? [ ] Who knew traditional modern? Photograph: Image Source/Getty Images Who knew traditional modern? Photograph: Image Source/Getty Images Hadley Freeman Hadley Freeman @HadleyFreeman Mon 27 Jan 2020 17.22 GMTLast modified Mon 27 Jan 2020 17.50 GMT * * * What exciting trends happening matrimonial sector? Kara, email A thrilling new trend emerged, it’s seismic New Look 40s fashion, emergence Mediterranean cooking 90s Britain: it’s called housewife. Now might think: “Ummm, doesn’t sound THAT new me.” But fashion trends rehashes, “tradwife”, one dubbed, housewife social media spin. It’s like bringing back 90s style, swapping brown eyeliner contouring makeup. It’s much zeitgeist, see? So “tradwife” woman doesn’t work look children, husband, home talk non-stop great social media. Who knew traditional also modern? And busy! Last week alone, interviews tradwives Daily Mail, Times BBC, This Morning, Victoria Derbyshire and, I know, piped 24/7 across channels. I’m afraid – non-trad non-wife – I less plugged women. But I especially taken one trad wife. Her name Alena Kate Pettitt, showing TV crews lovingly irons husband’s shirt shops onions, Pettitt runs something called Darling Academy, newsletter YouTube channel “celebrates British etiquette”. Initially, I assumed meant reviving mad Nancy Mitford U non-U stuff, and, let tell you, American wannabe snob, I VERY that. But no, Pettitt “harnessing best made Britain great, time could leave front door open know safe, knew strangers street.” Mmm, isn’t funny whenever people evoke specific time Britain great, time invariably evoke childhood aware pressures anxieties adulthood? And I’ll honest, every times Pettitt talks husband “taking care” her, pretty much No 1 subject, sounds like she’s talking father husband. The tradwives keenly giving interviews true feminists choosing work, anyone modicum knowledge feminism would say: “We gave women choice – that’s point! Bake banana bread sun comes up, makes happy!” Whether still true feminists suggesting “husbands must always come first want happy marriage”, Pettitt tweeted, feels debatable. Also unacknowledged that, much tradwives think renegade rebels working, rebellion based husband earning enough support whole household. Whoa there, little rebels! But isn’t actually fighting system: women fighting insecurities lives. And insecurities, insist oppressed ones, brave speakers truth. In words, it’s another pointless culture war chuck teetering pile Spiked Online Laurence Fox. And it’s also something else. Rather awkwardly British tradwives – like suggest movement dressing Cath Kidston letting husband choose going holiday – US elsewhere much part “alt-right” movement. It especially popular among white supremacists, extremely message white women submit husband focus making many white babies possible. British tradwives insist nothing them: “Someone even said, type housewife promoted Third Reich. And it’s like: ‘Really?! I didn’t even know that!’” Pettitt told BBC, sitting underneath union jack bunting, musing “we don’t even know identity country right now”. Now look, clearly happy housewife mean Nazi. But also, maybe it’s time dial notch, tradwives, sake? After all, you’re constantly posting videos YouTube press husband’s clothes, talking Phillip Holly love flirt husband, time tradwife-ing?

The problem always someone disapproves. __________________________________________________________________ Mina Niaza October 21, 2016 Until recently I’d felt feminism, came women working, baseless modern families, women choose either work stay home. But I’ve come realise reason I feel way I’m lucky enough raised environment I expected give dreams something trivial gender. Let tell story. I know someone married age twenty-six, accord. She already completed Bachelor’s degree distinction, continued work even getting married. Her daughter born, four years later established practice. This woman served board prestigious university, published numerous times, now, two decades later, fulfilling another dream completing Master’s degree full scholarship. I’d say that’s pretty accurate image well-established female. The woman’s husband supported every decision, never asking give dreams stay home. You say, “She would’ve never around, kids must suffered”? And yet, children happy, healthy, currently completing O A Levels one prestigious schools country. “They must family life,” think. Wrong again. The four form closer knit family – regularly go cinema together, eat breakfast dinner together, weekend complete without least one family friend gathering. When children born took time (about year half, times) worked part-time switched smaller nearby office could reach home within five minutes needed. Despite strong female figure life, daughter different. She dreams getting married early twenties huge desi wedding. She wants stay home children. Are thinking must mother neglects family daughter doesn’t want make mistake? No, never felt neglected, ever resented mother’s career, quite opposite actually, respects career. Are feminists shaking head her? Are assuming it’s life she’s airhead can’t successful? No, dumb. She intelligent. She manages maintain outstanding grades one sought-after schools country, applying top universities world, set high academic goals independent. The difference over, choose stop working become stay-at-home mom. Not pressured that’s husband would want, feels would make happier she’d want life. Personally, I relate daughter, close know this. I therefore left dumbfounded hurt tsk’d judged sharing post girls forced stay confined kitchen. Just I feel girls bound work kitchens day, doesn’t mean I’m saying girls cook degrades them. It I realised extent situation. The majority us segregated two poles. The first age-old “a girl cook, clean, stay home.” The second pushes women solely career driven. There stereotype house-wives stay-at-home moms regarded signs subservience accepted inferiority. The problem girls expected stay home, looked upon others comply. Do see pattern? There right answer, girl’s voice lost somewhere between. A middle ground must reached, woman choose either work stay home. To achieve this, must shift mind-sets extremes. Being career-oriented necessarily translate terrible homemaker. Choosing stay home take care family give people right judge “accepting male superiority.” The problem women want don’t want do. The problem whatever do, always someone disapprove. Feminists fight empower women sometimes fail realise women home empowered too. I radical feminist, I chauvinist. Yes, I want stay home. And no, I oppressed. WRITTEN BY: Mina Niaza The author A-Level pre-medical student Karachi Grammar School, many diverse interests ranging art graphic design national affairs.

Some men pronounce publicly favor women’s rights gender equality. They might even call feminists fight organisations, devoted implementation SDGs. In theory, sure sound good supporter women. However, looking homes, might always treat wife partner respect deserve. In article, would like draw closer look implementing gender equality home relationship. What mean marriage based principle gender equality? Which strategies values help couple live gender equality demanded SDG5? (And way, men among like “boss” family: You idea actually missing relationship :-)). Our five practical suggestions give possibility critically reflect subconscious behaviours couple. Number 1: Let’s talk money! Who earns money relationship? Even forward-thinking men don’t like admit wives earn money. But that? Is difficult men proud wives professionally successful? Doesn’t mean made good choice marrying intelligent partner? Money often intimidating. Then questions joint bank accounts, credit cards on. Whatever decide, make sure discuss first. Be honest feelings. If partner’s money intimidates you, say so. If feel like earning money changing career path, legitimate. When planning bigger investments, make decisions together. If want financially independent, that’s also fine. Just keep mind: Your relationship shouldn’t money. Money doesn’t define ability. Equality relationship means partners earn money, doesn’t matter earns it. Number 2: Let’s talk sex! Let’s deny it: Good sex important part good relationship. But defines good sex is? In relationship based equality partners sex, also talk it. Sometimes talking part even intimate actual sex. Sex discovering partner’s body partner’s wishes desires. An orgasm one-way-street, ultimate goal every intercourse. Much that, sexuality way getting closer together, create intimate space two you. Equality sexuality means nobody left behind. It also means partners refuse intercourse whenever don’t feel like it. And signifies pleasure partners equally important. So, go ahead talk it. And includes menstruation surely contraception, matter partners. Number 3: Let’s talk kids! Whenever kids come play relationship, things become complex. A new role distribution take place. Although normal mothers fathers take responsibilities 21^st century, many families seem back stone age birth child. Why can’t both, Mum Dad, wash baby, change nappies, feed child, wake night forth? If mother still breastfeeding, doesn’t mean Dad cannot take responsibilities make it: take child walk, bring partner water drink breastfeeding prepare dinner. Caring child lot work. It equally rewarding see close relationships mostly grow children Dad present things enumerated. Dads away time, miss lot great things. Of course, okay return work childbirth. However, right apply mothers fathers equally. Women often sacrifice careers condemned life-lasting part-time job doesn’t fulfill them. The important thing discuss want go life takes responsibilities. Number 4: Let’s talk support! Being relationship based equality doesn’t mean want things time. However, key word is: support! Your partner wants open creative online-shop – go it! You express opinion supportive time. Be happy partner’s success accompany achieve goals. Number 5: Let’s talk us! The key successful relationship, based gender equality supported mutual respect, communication. Communication sometimes means ability put behind personal anger needs express thoughts words. Whenever something bothering you, bring attention partner respectful way. A regular sit-together help discuss important aspects relationship life couple.

On one hand, Latina feminist, I aware patriarchal society governs women's roles relegates traditional domesticity. On other, though, I watched mother endure burns, scratches arthritic pain back-breaking work supports household — can't help admire appreciate work ethic. I offended even bit hurt, therefore, learn Dictionary.com defines "housewife" term “sometimes offensive." To fair, designation perhaps makes sense based relatively recent historical legacy established feminist movement 1960s 1970s. Being housewife largely regarded movement equitable giving one's power and, sense, coerced domestic work. Feminist leaders — like Betty Friedan, author famous book, The Feminist Mystique — perpetuated idea proposed women must reject domesticity breaking professional barriers claiming personal, sexual freedom. Rejecting "housewife" role part parcel effort. The current, negative connotation term "housewife," therefore, likely tied perception domestic work inherently oppressive. It's true decades many women choice housewives makes sense perpetually confined one role would make anyone hate occupation, matter nature. What's more, many women time likely hate housewives wanted something else life. But idea housewife somehow less worthy respect carried generation, despite fact many women options now. Maintaining belief therefore fails take account (and actively discredits) women genuinely enjoy housework. It also devalues work go "housewife." According 2014 survey Salary.com, example, average stay-at-home mom would made $188,905 2014 including 56.5 hours overtime. Working moms, according survey, would made $70,107, excluding money earn jobs outside home. Clearly, housewife easy job deserves respect. Now women many opportunities available them, housewife often choice rather role necessitated coercion lack opportunities. An interest domesticity make woman less feminist necessarily less independent work predominately outside home. While might say retire stigmatized term, would mean something wrong first place. Modern feminism prides respecting women’s choices, regardless much disagree them, retiring term would rob many women able make choice best families. Instead, women choose path reclaim — respect so. __________________________________________________________________ More articles Category: Feminism More articles Tag: Activism advocacy, Gender bias, News SHARE * * [SHARE] Article.DirectLink Categories * Feminism Recent Articles WMC IDAR/E [FURIA.jpg] A Failure Listen WMC Climate [Screen-Shot-2022-12-30-at-12.48.47.png] Finally, International Agreement Bring Women Climate Change Table WMC features [wmc_features_andrea-james-national-coucil-for-incarcerated-and-formerl y-incarcerated-women-and-girls-team.jpg] Senate Report Reveals Widespread Sexual Abuse Women US Federal Prisons WMC Women Under Siege [1671616796216.jpg] India’s Supreme Court Decision Abortion Rights Could Go Further Protecting Women Marital Rape WMC FBomb [wmc_features_Kamala_Harris_official_portrait_072121.jpeg] When Will Women Finally Be Equally Represented American Politics?

Why women leave children go work? Some women decide work financial reasons, escape home, relieve stress, etc. February 12, 2015 What kind woman you: A housewife career woman? Follow Saudigazette Google News Account Why women leave children go work? Some women decide work financial reasons, escape home, relieve stress, etc. However, older generation believe women work instead homemakers. Yet believe women work family benefit many ways. To begin with, working mother family help family financially. A working woman career aspirations set responsibilities. But housewife, life starts ends husband, children family There advantages disadvantages working woman housewife. Working women leave children care housemaid someone else. However, cannot trust housemaids, cannot give care mother give. I asked women feel housewife working woman Saudi Arabia. Their opinions follows: Ayesha, Indian housewife, said: “I educated housewife. After returning school, children happy find home. They much talk about. A housewife help children homework, says housewives contributing family financially? They save cost housemaid private tuition well. This major contribution. Moreover, joy child’s face enough reward me!” Fatima Khan, Pakistani, said: “As working woman, I know painful leave children home go work. I sometimes wish I could stay home possible I want give child better life better education. Housewives also contribute lot family. It’s easy task sacrifice career stay home cook look children. I feel working home difficult working office.” Anna, Philippines, said: “I graduate I working marriage. After I moved Saudi Arabia, I realized good would know someone, everything. When come back office, get proper attention care aspire to. Your children given proper personal care attention, important makes bond parents children stronger. My children teenagers I must spend time order make feel secure keep away negative thoughts.” A Saudi woman said: “Men given Islamic responsibility providing women, default financially dependent father, husband brother. In earlier days, women enjoyed luxury home, cooking, watching TV, reading newspapers housework. Now women wish work earn themselves. However, try maintain balance work family. “If woman fears God, allow work affect Islamic obligations, offering daily five prayers time, fasting Ramadan, gaining Islamic knowledge, reciting Holy Qur’an wearing hijab. So opinion, women work family responsibility prime importance.” Heena Syed, Sri Lankan, said: “In today’s world, salary husband wife required order good home, good car good bank balance children’s future. The work parents essential progress family. Being husband children 24 hours day mean woman perfect mother. A working woman understands value work. Unlike housewife, never blames husband late office. Working women often find fulfillment jobs, apart home. Hence, may better life satisfaction feel less dependent husbands. This turn lead harmony family.” Sana Obaid, Saudi, said: “I work teacher I feel kids financially secure. They join extra coaching programs enroll activities per wish. I spend weekends fully kids husband I personally feel working women affect family.” Jabida, Indian, said: “I want say I disagree idea housewives less educated. I worked I needed to. Right I stay home I love it. I teach daughter alphabet, numbers, colors, shapes, etc. We go outside various activities, cooking, cleaning list goes on. I also help husband working computer programs. In way I content.” Mohamed Hasan, Indian student, said: “I feel choice given lady. If wishes work, confident handle working family obligations spouse family willing support her, career. It lead fulfillment. And changing times, lady also work home, part time, flexible hours. So let choose whether wants career wants housewife.” So conclude, I would like share example Hazrat Khadija (may Allah pleased her) wife beloved Prophet (peace upon him).

That’s profession. The job housewife hardly job. It’s duty.” We live 21st century. As country proudly highlight progress citing existence burgeoning female workforce, one includes highly educated skilled professionals. Yet, cannot deny fact majority Indian women still go work. Instead, work home. Not home entrepreneurs freelancers, rather houses, housewives. At core every family, nuclear joint, housewife. The importance physical presence underscored stasis household comes around. She single-handedly runs it, juggling chores cooking, washing, cleaning caretaking great skill. Emotionally, holds family together. She pillar support husband, guiding light child, harbour family’s elderly. It’s though existence entirely selfless, always putting interests others own.

She also deals physical, financial human resources. Her decisions affect lives people well-being home. However, work quite considered ‘job’. A CEO gets paid millions, work goes unacknowledged. She rarely even receives gratitude; remuneration, then, seems like ridiculous idea. The patriarchal understanding role housewife job duty. She perform tasks daily basis, irrespective whether likes wants all. Her job thankless. But again, job job. Her skills marketable; breadwinner house.

The revisionism fueled recent case Andrea Yates, Texas mother drowned five young children bathtub. The murders allegedly committed Yates suffered postpartum depression aggravated stay-at-home mom. Cheryl L. Meyer, coauthor forthcoming book Mothers Who Kill Their Children associate professor psychology Wright State University, expressed new feminist line stay-at-home moms article Womens Enews (June 27), popular feminist Web site. Meyer wrote, The reality mother kills child every mother, mother. In positing Yates Every Woman, Meyer continues, Most mothers seem understand woman could kill child. When target certain cases try ascertain particular mother could killed child, mask important question, dont mothers this? Marcia Wilkie, coauthor Marie Osmonds autobiographical account postpartum depression, intimately linked Americas sweetheart murderous Yates Newsweek article (July 2). In column issue, Playing God No Sleep, Pulitzerprize-winning Anna Quindlen argued every mother secretly identified killing children. She described typical stay-at-home housewife way: Shes tired, shes hot shes night throwing sheets washer smaller two boys projectile vomiting severe looks like special effect The Exorcist. Oh, shes nauseated, too, since already two kids age 5 made perfect sense another, shes four months pregnant. With housework added unsavory mix, Every Woman lives verge snapping committing infanticide. A myth created PC feminism dying new one created replace it. The dying myth women commit acts domestic violence: men do. It well documented wives assault husbands approximately rate husbands assault wives. The statistics regarding fatal child abuse even alarming. A Bureau Justice report titled Murder Families (NCJ 143498) surveyed murder cases tried 1988 discovered 55 percent defendants charged killing children women. The Third National Incidence Study Child Abuse Neglect (NIS-3, 1996) Department Health Human Services reported mothers perpetrate 78 percent fatal child abuse. Even granting women usually primary caregivers thus much opportunity motive snap, figures alarmingly high. They high subject much attention longer credible claim women nonviolent home. To preserve image women victims oppressive male society, however, PC feminists find necessary explain murder child mother still fault men. The first step remove responsibility mother blaming acts postpartum depression insanity women identify. The second step castigate traditional family stay-at-home mom breeding ground pathology women. Since PC feminists already decry traditional family bastion white male culture barrier womens actualizing potential, next leap logic easy. Murdering moms driven violence men impregnate trap psychologically devastating role housewife. Thus many voices media blame Andrea Yatess husbanda man one suggested ever violenteven express sympathy Andrea herself. They blame society recognizing Andreas plight. Friedan Called Question Interestingly, current debate housewifery comes time validity book sparked original debate severely questioned. In 1963 Betty Friedans book The Feminine Mystique, spoke the problem name. Stated simply, domesticity denied housewives humanity potential, making suffer physically mentally. Friedan described typical 50s family comfortable concentration camp. Like camp inmates, suburban housewives adjusted psychologically become dependent, passive, childlike lived lower human level. Selling millions copies, The Feminine Mystique became powerful force shaping American culture credited inspiring Second Wave feminism. Certainly led Friedans co-founding National Organization Women (1966). The book taken rightful place icon Cultural Revolution 1960s 70s women flooded home university workplace. As women continued read Friedans book, idea housewifery pathology cemented feminism. Recent works thoroughly discredited Friedans arguments, power derived claims personal experience authorities cited support claims. In book Betty Friedan Making Feminine Mystique (1998), Daniel Horowitz explored Friedans background debunked myth ever represented typical suburban housewife persistently claimed. Friedan staunch political activist communist left decades first book appeared. Horowitzs analysis damning leftist sympathetic politics. He argues hid past afraid persecuted McCarthy witch hunts. Whatever Friedans motives may been, make The Feminine Mystique appear disingenuous. In 1973 article New York Times Magazine titled Up From Kitchen Floor, Friedan claimed wrote book early 60s, I wasnt even conscious woman problem. Yet 1951 Betty Goldstein (Friedans maiden name) wrote article titled UE [the United Electrical, Radio Machine Workers America] Drive Wage, Job Discrimination Wins Cheers Women Members (UE News, April 16) reported labor meeting. Goldstein described women fighters refuse longer paid treated inferior species bosses, male workers swallowed bosses thinking. The fact readers Friedans book identified sister-housewife naïvely bought domesticity myth one reason The Feminine Mystiques huge success. The readership would never identified real Friedan: left-wing labor journalist; member Marxist discussion groups; author union pamphlet UE Fights Women Workers (June 1952), critiqued wage discrimination based sex; rent striker; career woman hired really good mother-substitutea housekeeper-nurse (Charm, April 1955). In article titled Rethinking Betty Friedan The Feminine Mystiquee: Labor Union Radicalism Feminism Cold War America (American Quarterly, March 1996), Horowitz argued examination Friedans communist past subsequent shift toward respectability illustrates significant turn within ideology left 1950s. It microcosm Old Left evolved politically correct New Left. The ideology expanded economic analysis, based Marxism, include humanistic psychology focus the effect consumption middle class. In analysis, contemporary feminism merely subset New Left. In addition questions Friedans credentials housewife, grave doubt cast interpretation experts The Feminine Mystique based facts presented experts themselves. In Atlantic Monthly (September 1999), Alan Wolfe, director Center Religion American Public Life Boston College, raised question whether book arrive larger truths bricks built wont stand time. This question particularly relevant The Feminine Mystique, relies heavily appeals authority, psychologists Freud Abraham Maslow anthropologist Margaret Mead sex researcher Alfred Kinsey. In using experts, Friedan dips work, citing evidence supports position ignoring whatever contradicts it. Even supporting evidence longer provides real prop. In years following publication Friedans book, much selectively cited research discredited. For example, Derek Freemans book The Fateful Hoaxing Margaret Mead: A Historical Analysis Her Samoan Research (1999) effectively countered claims made Meads work Coming Age Samoaa book highly touted The Feminine Mystique. The credibility Kinsey fared even worse rampant bias methodology revealed. Wolfe concludes, To make case women required freedom, Friedan felt necessary exaggerate degree lived slavery. Unfortunately argument, treatment serious social problem relies authority experts appears far less persuasive experts turn telling just-so stories. Without backing solid statistics research, Friedans work nothing offer anecdotal evidence unhappiness housewives proceeds define reality basis. Friedans credibility fallen hard times. Even admiring biographer Judith Hennessee strangely critical subject book Betty Friedan: Her Life (1999). In introduction admits disappointed Friedan person opposed Friedan thinker. Hennessee speaks feminist often rude nasty who . . . even like women; wife inflicted received much violence marriage three children required therapy to distance emotional fallout. Despite criticism, however, undeniably true The Feminine Mystique spoke many women whose lives changed result reading book. For them, housewife negation potential human beings, discovered courage reach make different choice. But voices within feminism content view domesticity simply choice appealed women others. So new political mythology housewifery born. The Myth Housewife In 60s mainstream feminism liberal contained strong bias toward reforming marriage make equal. For example, men exhorted housework share greater responsibility child rearing. In short, The Feminine Mystique call abolition marriage, merely transformation. Years later, politically correct gender feminism built Friedans work argue abolition marriage, objected. In book The Second Stage (1981) explained gender feminists misinterpreting meaning. She pleaded move away antifamily rhetoric back dialogue men improve institution marriage. What substance antifamily rhetoric Friedan objected? The gender feminist assault traditional family, including stay-at-home moms, dated Kate Milletts influential book Sexual Politics (1970). Milletts views extreme presentation radical. For example, dealing male-female relations (sexual politics), Millett dwelt almost obsessively pornography sado-masochistic literature. In attacking sexual politics assaulted entire structure power societythat is, white male culture known patriarchy. Marriage posited agency maintained traditional pattern mans power woman. Milletts work followed fleshed extreme voices. Consider small sampling books quickly ensued: Ellen Pecks The Baby Trap (1971) argued babies block liberation; Kathrin Perutzs Marriage Hell (1972) defined heterosexual sex political power struggle; Jill Johnstons Lesbian Nation (1973) called heterosexual females traitors. The popular anthology Sisterhood Powerful (1970) contained 74 essays; one anything motherhood. A new theory housewife evolving role political status chattel. To gender feminists, marriage family became inextricably bound private property, class structure, mode production. In words, family aspect capitalism. The seeds analysis found Friedrich Engels, coauthor Communist Manifesto author much quoted Millett. In book The Origin Family, Private Property, State (1884) Engels argued oppression women sprang nuclear family, believe oppression occurred throughout history. It emerged dawn capitalism which, claimed, work men women valued equally. In nineteenth century, however, industrialization supposedly brought separation home productive work caused transfer mens labor home farm factories. Women remained hearth. Thus men came dominate public realm women confined private one. Although women ventured factories well, received lower pay independence illusory. With emergence wide-scale capitalism, women said relegated roles breeding, maintaining men, buying consumer goods. Mothers provided next appropriately indoctrinated generation laborers capitalists; housewives maintained male workforce cleaning cooking; housekeepers enriched capitalist structure consuming products produced. As early gender feminists Nicole Cox Silvia Federici explained pamphlet Counter-Planning Kitchen: Wages Housework, Housework . . . servicing wage earner physically, emotionally, sexually, getting ready work day day wage. It taking care children . . . ensuring perform ways expected capitalism. To gender feminists housework direct expression mans oppression women capitalisms exploitation. As such, housework surplus labor. To restate feminist concept: Capitalism process means production pay wages workers produce goods worth wages paid. The worth excess wages paid called surplus value labor absorbed capitalists unearned profit. The surplus value housework enables mens labor. Mens labor unearned profit capitalism absorbs. Thrown economic condemnation housework traditional family bastions capitalism accusations. For example, housewives said kept isolation encourages domestic violence. From analysis sprang popular feminist slogan The personal political. Susan Moller Okin explained origins book Justice, Gender, Family (1991). Okin wrote, The earliest claims personal political came gender feminists 1960s 1970s argued that, since family root womens oppression, must smashed. She disputes assumption family arrangements treated personal, private matters rather political ones: state enter domestic scene. To object, Okin replies state already intervenes establishing social political background family functions. Expanding intervention by, example, requiring payment housework matter degree, kind. Whether Friedan comfortable manner theories spun out, logical conclusion calling suburban household a concentration camp women. And new myth appears: stay-at-home moms oppressed women psychologically damaged trapped likely snap pressure. As isolated victims male society, understandable experience psychotic episodes kill children. Indeed, so, expressing victimhood, gone unrecognized society large. A New/Old View Housewifery Fortunately, voices sanity remain. One belongs Mimi Gladstein speaks individualist feminist book [from The Independent Institute] Liberty Women (Ivan R. Dee, spring 2002). Individualist feminism views staying home raise family choice every bit valid entering work force. Gladsteins essay begins, We dont hire housewives, response received asked joining faculty University Texas El Paso, associate dean liberal arts. Gladstein refused devalued human housewife. That jobno less teaching university Englishexpressed worth competence. Even more, housewife training ground learned skills setting priorities budgeting time. Gladstein writes, All I really needed know chairing department, I learned Jewish Mother. Gladstein describes suburban housewife trained handle taking executive director universitys Diamond Jubilee celebration. She writes, That job allowed use housewifery skills create manage events diverse football half-times, city-wide street festivals, physics fairs, student retention programs, Vietnam Memorial dedications, city university planning commissions year-long program national internally renowned speakers. She learned necessary skills juggling childrens schedules, planning family budget, hostess husbands business events. Choice key individualist feminism whether housework damaging women. To women choose stay home raise family, fulfilling use time, also teach management skills translate well workplace afterwards. In approaching marriage family, feminist slogan be: the personal personal. Individuals choose, state role.

A prominent MP welcomed idea, saying "monetise services women homemakers, enhance power autonomy" create near-universal basic income. This compelling debate, especially time women losing ground paid work. All around world, women spend time unpaid work - ranging maximum 345 minutes per day Iraq 168 minutes per day Taiwan, according International Labour Organisation. On average, men spent 83 minutes unpaid care work women spent three times 265 minutes. So housewives paid wages largely thankless household chores? India's 160 million homemakers, like many counterparts rest world, clean, tidy, cook, wash manage family finances. They fetch food, water firewood, give care children in-laws. They spend 297 minutes day domestic work, compared 31 minutes men. A quarter men engaged unpaid chores, compared four-fifths women. Legal scholar Gautam Bhatia argued unpaid housework "forced labour". Arpan Tulsiyan, research scholar Delhi University, says "important recognise value unpaid domestic work". What well known half-a-century, Indian courts actually awarding compensation unpaid work done homemakers. But death.

She found country's courts developed "path-breaking" legal framework concerning "robust wages housework": judges put value unpaid work women died road accidents awarded compensation dependants. In calculating value housework, judges looked opportunity cost - something given order something else - woman's decision work home, considered minimum wages skilled unskilled workers, taken account educational qualifications deceased woman, adjusted compensations accounting age considering whether children not. In December, court awarded compensation 1.7 million rupees ($23,263; £17,019) family 33-year-old homemaker died road accident, fixing notional salary 5,000 rupees month. The Supreme Court awarded lump sum amounts 9,000 rupees month notional income deceased housewife aged 34-59 years lower amount elderly women, aged 62-72. Compensation decreased age courts believed would less childcare work children grew up. Wherever possible, judges tried keep pace inflation. In one judgement, judges viewed marriage "equal economic partnership" homemaker's salary would half husband's salary.

In case, court ruled cost husband "maintaining" wife would equal imagined salary, compensation awarded him. Some compensation payments calculated courts "paltry", Prof Kotiswaran says, "the principle recognition unpaid work par occupation quite noteworthy". It begs question: family compensated unpaid work done woman died, pay women alive? Lawyers may able use judgments "trigger developments constitutional law family laws recognise unpaid work housewives normal times, rather times disruption", Prof Kotiswaran says. Paying wages women unpaid work home would also boost India's declining female labour participation rate. "I arguing salaries housewives, broader wages-for-housework movement. Organisations like UN Women focused unpaid work obstacle paid work," Prof Kotiswaran says. "The focus seems get women paid work. The Indian women's movement focused many laudable issues asking big question labour performed within marriage."

By Rohitha Naraharisetty Jan 7, 2019 4 min read The word ‘housewife’ product marriage (pun intended) capitalism patriarchy, breaking word yields two factors ideology ultimately determine woman’s social location. ‘House’ indicates site labour – private sphere, ‘wife’ ascribed status relation man legally bound husband marriage contract. Put together, words naturalises role married woman one perform unpaid domestic labour home. In words, wife performing unpaid labour become synonymous other. Housewife word complicit erasure agency married women defining terms relationships domestic obligations correspond. Recognition word’s implications nullifying self determination agency renders incompatible feminist politics works dismantle structural conditions oppression, language playing key role same. Work ascribed women valued less also cheapened help patriarchy privileges masculinity femininity. In order unpack ‘housewife’ problematic word, idea ‘work’ must problematised. One key ideas capitalism tries sell equation financial capital agency. What left unquestioned kind work monetarily valued capitalism kind not. Most often, work ascribed women according traditional gender roles valued less, also cheapened help patriarchy privileges masculinity femininity. As result, work women do, associated doing, valued less feminine labour care-work domestic chores become relegated unpaid lesser paid end work spectrum. Traditionally, masculine jobs paid hence defined time ‘work’ per capitalist definition incorporates income profit logics. To use word housewife women don’t “work”, therefore, leave idea work unproblematised, also actively playing capitalist patriarchal ideology requires whole section people’s work undervalued therefore unpaid order sustain machinery production profit. If wife’s duty, according gender norms, sustain family, work house order natural role must therefore paid for. The word also serves essential function devaluing domestic labour itself; setting oppositional ‘actual work’, implicitly negates use value work performed home order make sound logical work paid for. If wife’s duty, according gender norms, sustain family, work house order natural role must therefore paid for. The naturalisation work also allows viewed unskilled work, contributes devaluation same. Ultimately, word comes implications order justify paying recognising domestic labour real work. Additionally, word allows privatisation care domestic labour due fact reinforcing easy congruity housework wife enables state governing entity relegate private sphere view worthy public investment. Also read: In Photos: Women At Work – The Many Facets Of Women’s Labour The implications word lieu hidden meaning, therefore, many. It reinforces public/private divide often cited many feminist scholars distinction excludes women integrating civil society confining traditional gender roles within private sphere. It also gender neutral, unpaid labour home domain work housewives specific women; association femininity, men escape devaluation therefore commonly used counterpart word housewife. The word used women ties capitalist exploitation patriarchal subordination create identity allow thinking women agency own. When ‘housewife’ associated “not working,” importance domestic labour sustaining capitalism swept aside women made feel devalued subjects themselves. While unpaid domestic work must challenged devaluation, power dynamics within employer-employee relationship capitalism may harmful potential exacerbate women’s subordination roles wives. It must noted function unpaid labour performs capitalist patriarchy reproduction labour power, work allows someone else re-enter workforce engage paid labour everyday. When ‘housewife’ associated ‘not working’, importance domestic labour sustaining capitalism swept aside women made feel devalued subjects themselves. There therefore need new word recognises inconsistencies respect feminist practice, would interrogate conditions leading devaluation work instead allowing sustain word. While ‘homemaker’ one alternative gained mainstream traction away ‘wife’ suffix, still address fact capitalism relies devaluation work people order perpetuate itself, leaves oppressive origins work unproblematised.

After reading recent study suggests women would rather divorced dishes, Jennifer defends “traditional” role housewives. Jennifer Pinarski February 11, 2013 Photo SuburbanSport via Flickr. When I’m mood snark irreverence, Jezebel never disappoints. This week, housewives fire headline “Most Women Would Rather Kick Their Husbands Curb Than Be Housewife” catching attention. Highlighting research Kathleen Gerson’s 2009 book, The Unfinished Revolution, Jezebel pokes fun 1950s stereotype woman stays home husband brings home bacon, calling traditional role “quaint.” After all, doesn’t every woman want totally equal partner? That’s 80% women 70% men want — least according Gerson’s research. But Gerson asked study subjects would found relationship men women couldn’t sustain equal partnership, 75% women said would rather ask husband divorce stay marriage home children. My friend, Chantal, shocked statistic stated 70% men asked question said hoped wives would “de-prioritize” career focus homemaking. Instead jumping bandwagon saying men don’t care women’s careers — bulk commenters wrote Jezebel — I want flip statistic around highlight depresses me: Only 25% Gerson’s female study subjects would choose kids career. To study says less importance women workplace little young, unmarried people value family. Believe me, I didn’t grow dreaming stay-at-home mom, I part study group 15 years ago I would answered question way. But marriage children funny way changing priorities and, second child, husband I decided best place home — joint decision based fact income could support choice mine could not. There moments new life housewife 20-year-old career-minded self would cringed at, now, stay-at-home parent cooking cleaning, I say confidently divorce option I would choose. But misconception housewife’s role marriage little cooking bacon husband brings home, course divorce seems attractive singleton. Truth is, housewife isn’t unpaid janitor — see us insulting. I see full-time caregiver children but, importantly, marriage (I consider chores pesky side jobs I see real job housewife). Here statistics I’d like see 15 years now, initiatives like income splitting tax breaks put place, enabling parents stay home care marriages children: * children read sing often literate * divorce rates fall * youth crime reduced * children eat healthier fewer cases diabetes * children play outside obesity obsolete Hopefully mommy blogger like say, “look old study 2009, thought housewife didn’t matter. How quaint.” Photo SuburbanSport via Flickr.

Their loyalty, however, dead rather living kings, wishes dead kings made known spirit mediums are, according David Graeber wonderful Fragments Anarchist Anthropology, “usually elderly women common descent.” Which say that, officially, Sakalava governed elite men, ordinary elderly women literal voices authority. I’m sure we’re much different. We governed mostly elite men, quite lot seemingly dead, everything culture encourages us regard rulers central sole source power. But history changed people supposedly powerless, including women veiled dismissive moniker housewife. When Kristen Breitweiser, Patty Casazza, Lorie Van Auken, Mindy Kleinberg, widows men killed attacks World Trade Center, started research demanding answers elected representatives, gave rise 9/11 Commission. Nicknamed Jersey Girls, became experts national security terrorism. A year towers collapsed, one spoke forcefully Congress really happened. A year half that, 9/11 Commission issued official verdict ties Saddam Hussein Al Qaeda. By time, Jersey Girls campaigning Bush’s re-election. They didn’t win one, won’t go away, Seattle-area mothers mentally disabled children ran roadblock roadblock getting children public school educations basic rights. Those three mothers, Evelyn Chapman, Katie Dolan, Jane Taggart, went, friend Susan Schwartzenberg says forthcoming book, Becoming Citizens: Family Life Politics Disability, “from outraged mothers sophisticated activists utilizing well-honed network politicians, labor leaders, legislators, judges media.” In 1971, Washington State passed law paved way national Education All Act 1975, renamed IDEA — Individuals Disabilities Education Act — 1990. I think Lois Gibbs Love Canal upstate New York, started investigating rash illnesses working-class neighborhood, founded Love Canal Homeowners Association 1978, continued connecting dots fighting power became founding figure environmental justice movement. Today director Center Health, Environment, Justice, helping people find voice oppose destruction fighting reduce human exposure poisons like dioxin. Her work helped generate Environmental Protection Agency. I think Las Madres de Este Los Angeles, succeeded keeping succession toxic dumps, incinerators, chemical treatment plant East L.A. neighborhood 1980s 1990s. I think Women Strike Peace, faced anticommunist authorities height Cold War protest nuclear arms race, nuclear weapons, nuclear testing causing catastrophic damage environment human health — particularly infants children. They started November 1961 one-day strike mode Lysistrata, hundred thousand cities across country leaving homes stand arms war. The members WSP subversively used gender genteel, housewifely image suggest government wasn’t radical sensible, motherly, kindhearted. This might secret housewife theory history: These women take qualities supposed render irrelevant use defiantly well strategically. Starting love, cut straight quicksand motives purposes point harm done stopped. In sense, depoliticize politics, makes politically potent. When asked whether cahoots Soviets, WSP activists said thought perhaps Soviet mothers didn’t want children afflicted fallout either. Women Strike Peace achieved two signal victories. One contribution end aboveground nuclear testing Limited Test Ban Treaty 1963, huge step forward limiting arms race environmental damage. The decline fall House Un-American Activities Committee, Homeland Security Grand Inquisition day. When interrogated, WSP women trial mocked exposed heavy-handed fearmongering HUAC helped destroy it, making possible far freer political expression. They opposed Vietnam War early on. And 60s, era often associated young men, jump-started women used hats gloves baby carriages part arsenal. You could go farther afield Buenos Aires, Mothers Plaza de Mayo became fearless visible opposition terrifying regime organizing women across Argentina contacting international human rights organizations. They still walk protest Plaza de Mayo, center nation, every week. They used status mothers reject definitions government offered “disappeared”: These terrorists, beloved children could erased. You could look women Niger Delta, since 1986 repeatedly shut Shell Chevron’s oil facilities. But even home history clear: 9/11 Commission, EPA, Limited Test Ban Treaty, Education All Act. That’s radically different landscape might occupied activists stood clan. The typical cinematic consequence personal injury outraged paterfamilias avenging family gun, role played Charles Bronson, Bruce Willis, Clint Eastwood, George Bush. These killers don’t pursue principles seek prevent harm; instead inflict revenge. Silkwood Erin Brockovich anomalies. They illustrate housewife-become-activist shifts defending tribe defending principle everyone free fallout dioxin, everyone education know truth government doing. She fights revenge, rights. The community develops generates organizations, legislation, laws, education, awareness. It’s saga expanding connections, killer heroes movies remain strikingly isolated. One problems unions organizers America dominant stories world gets changed feature lone heroes, collectives associations. The unsung builders associations make shift personal local national principle, becomes way continue taking care. The Greek word oikos, meaning house, root word ecologist, could defined as, among things, housewife. It’s I’m fixated housewives, one among many categories individual taken power change world, it’s I believe category housewife compelling definition women lives often staying home kids. It’s that, Sakalava officially ruled kings elderly commoner women talking, officially rescued action-hero loners others real work organizing save world (from, among things, action-hero loners).

One day Chinese language class, teacher asked us question. Actually question directed boys. ‘How many would prefer wife housewife?’ And surprise (and time, indignation) almost boys class raised hands. For someone like brought dual income household naturally thought women equal rights men, pretty jarring moment. I couldn’t imagine career. The thing is, I’m older seen world, I find asking, ‘Is possible I become housewife 2-3 years I start children?’. The thought ‘Would bad?’ crossed mind too. Screen Shot 2013-12-19 6.04.48 PM As 15 year old boys thought, society still much deferent men, man breadwinner woman takes care family. So many girl friends (who studied 5 years university professional degree) put hold careers babies. But ever heard man taking time careers raise children? Simply unimaginable. For modern Asian woman, full time career, due way nature works, still carry babies term, due societal cultural conditioning, performs majority child rearing. And seems ladies don’t really mind taking duties childcare concerned. In fact seem want to. If you’re South Korean, female ambitious, one sought dreams become flight stewardess. 20,000 women apply every year, including top graduates universities, 150 get job. Why flight stewardess? Because pays well, flexible hours, perhaps importantly, pathway good marriage. Apparently 5 years quit get married. IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/AbUCLtWiPV8 Asian women also underrepresented every level top management Asia. Compared Western counterparts, Asians seem less ambitious. Is pressure traditional societal expectations force us put family first career later?enablejsapi=1&amp;html5=1&amp; Or actually feel want stay home cultural norm makes easier us make decision? For personally, it’s revelation, I’ve quite change heart 15 year old self. I feel like I’m ambitious I back then, I really wouldn’t mind taking years focus raising children. Whether purely psychological seeing lot people I know setting families, consequence innate hormone releasing biological clock compels women children fertility wanes, I still idea. However, one thing teenage boys didn’t take account rising cost living. As article The Edge Malaysia put it, dual income household become indispensable want children, especially you’re solidly middle class. So whether afford one parent working awhile become big issue. Source: The Edge Malaysia Source: The Edge Malaysia So therein lies dilemmas modern woman: want need spend time family, also need income careers, we’re lucky, think career building. As Anne-Marie Slaughter put highly viral article The Atlantic, unless you’re superhuman, rich self employed, women still can’t all. And perhaps lot Asian women living Asia, don’t want first place.

Although performed often play, ostensible equality women men modern-day society justifies every recurrence. The recent iteration “Little Women” hit Chicago area presented First Folio Theatre Mayslake Peabody Estate Oak Brook. After twenty-six years, founding executive director David Rice retiring closing company, making “Little Women” third-to-last production final season. The lives four March sisters framed dark mahogany wood beams numerous nooks filled bursting books spacious attic. Jo (Shelby Lynn Bias) independent, voracious reader aspiring writer. Oldest sister Meg (Stephanie Fongheiser) Jo’s near-opposite, content marry become housewife. Third-oldest Beth (Jamie Herb) resembles Dickensian heroine—subdued, angelic, trying please everyone—too good world. The youngest sister, Amy (Esther Fishbein), brat, grows become mature-ish artist. Each personality trait amplified maximum, making girls appear childish ages—Amy, twelve years old, comes across seven eight, developmental drop afflicts characters. But chemistry feels right, interactions, though highly animated, come genuine heartfelt. Jamie Herb (Laurie) Esther Fishbein (Amy) First Folio Theatre’s “Little Women”/Photo: Tom McGrath The actors perform double duty, everyone except Bias playing sister male love interest. Fishbein briefly steps shoes Meg’s future husband, John Brooke, Fongheiser manages German-ish accent Professor Bhaer. Herb plays Laurie, Jo’s eager, wide-eyed childhood boyfriend, not-so-secretly pines throughout friendship. Among fans ongoing debate whether Jo married Laurie not. This production unambiguous asserting Jo would never happy immature whiny partner, winds falling older Professor Bhaer. Two visual metaphors used great effect. While Paris, Amy uses inflatable red balloons symbolize art, releasing every work deems masterpiece sent squealing twisting air. In brilliant scene production, new housewife Meg loses mind attempting make currant jam, lightweight juggling scarves representing many things “up air.” Director Melanie Keller moves show along quick pace keeps viewer enthralled. The adaptation, written Heather Chrisler, contains big twists Alcott would approve of. Today, phrase “what woman” slur used men television politics denigrate others. The women “Little Women,” defined clearly First Folio Theatre’s recent production, show womanhood exists spectrum. It’s sad we—mostly men—need reminder, works like important, performers audiences return again. “Little Women” First Folio Theatre Company Mayslake Peabody Estate, 1717 31st Street Oak Brook, firstfolio.org, (630)986-8067.

It started 40 years ago, letter paper led register bored women stuck home suburbia. And now? Raekha Prasad Mon 28 Feb 2000 23.50 GMT * * * It sharp frustration dollop sympathy Guardian journalist Betty Jerman wrote surburbia 40 years ago. The open space fresh air, said, made good place bring children, feared advantages outweighed brain-numbing atmosphere. "Surburbia incredibly dull place live I blame women," wrote. "They stay day. They set tone. Many look back regret days worked office. Their work kept alert. Home childminding blunting effect woman's mind. But sharpen it." Jerman's observations struck chord reader Maureen Nicol. She wrote paper suggesting "housebound wives liberal interests desire remain individuals could form national register, whenever one moves, one contact like-minded friends". An avalanche letters sent paper desperate women country felt floundering society expected wives mothers. Women educated but, like mothers them, found trapped domestic sphere, often sticks husband's job, even they'd found kindred spirit nearby. Local groups formed years later acquired name National Housewives' Register. In absence personal income, early members admit fiddling housekeeping raise small membership fee. Today groups meet every week discuss everything except domestic, debates current affairs, book groups speakers invited every public sphere. Year year membership grew until, 1980, peaked 24,000. This enthusiasm proved Virginia Woolf right when, A Room Of One's Own, wrote: "Women sat indoors millions years, time walls permeated creative force, has, indeed, overcharged capacity bricks mortar must needs harness pens brushes business politics." Numbers falling since 80s; today 8,000 women members known since 1987 National Women's Register. The change title raises question organisation's future. The oldest member 92 though members late 20s, generation women means rushing join. NWR may celebrating ruby anniversary organisation born alleviate lot housewife survive drink golden when, politically personally, apparently dead buried? Imagine outcry Tony Blair made example housewife's foresight way Margaret Thatcher did. The title banished social history archives rears head unreconstructed genres TV quiz shows market research questionnaires. The spic 'n' span 50s feather duster image British housewife went Hilda Ogden Ken Dodd. Instead, debate women domesticity evolved anxiety keeping house bringing children. So whereas better "him" woman stay home, argument best kids. The observation Jerman made mental "pay-off' housewife makes still echoes. What's best children may what's best modern woman. The lack status implied prefix "just" housewife died term attaches word mother. "Working mother" rolls tongue ease "housewife" did. These women longer go voluntary exile marry children but, argues Mary Dodkins, NWR's marketing co-ordinator, still need space someone's wife mother, place opinionated without fear consequences. Today, members work, rules extended - discussion domestic still stands jobs out-of-bounds subject. "The purpose meetings still stimulate grey cells," Dodkins says. "Many women feel limited job position. It place feel real thoughts said, controversial discussions are, better." For Kathryn de Motte, 37 youngest area organiser 30-strong NWR group Nottingham, emphasis speaking mind crucial. She works secretary finds opinions says articulate anywhere else."We different hats," explains. "I'm mother, I'm wife I work, there's never space me. We get together exercise diet open minds." De Motte speaks enthusiastically subjects speakers discussions introduced her: badgers, local history learning juggle lighter end; Kafka, fox-hunting infant mortality rates serious. But women juggle domestic work, need NWR? "It's still important like-minded women," de Motte says. "Women still pressures men. In husband's life, strongest role job, I role wife mother. We need space us - without children." Time home, alone, without chores, still often felt shirking responsibility. De Motte, example, attend NWR meetings husband away employing babysitter would "leave guilt-ridden". So although women define paid job, often definition addition to, instead of, domestic labour. Pauline Reymond, long-time NWR member regional organiser Worthing, joined group 29 child started school. Now 64, notes members "partners" well husbands many divorced, widowed remarried. Her life goes way explaining how, term "housewife" made redundant social forces, also created them. Reymond give job secretary Royal Exchange Insurance company employ married women. "It way things were," says. Though Reymond would leave job today, things changed: matter call them, still women housework. The last Office National Statistics figures showed that, £739bn, unpaid housework worth value formal economy. And domesticity still hard work. The best outcome hope for, far NWR goes, continue fall victim success.

They never needed permission anyway. My mother urban woman English-medium education. She Bachelors Master’s degrees Arts, voracious reader. She’s never shied away speaking mind almost never politically correct. The word “diplomatic” doesn’t exist mother’s dictionary. She wears whatever likes whenever likes, others’ opinions damned. She stands ground arguments matter who’s end, seldom puts people’s nonsense (she gives back equal measure), always self-assured woman. She’s one confident people I’ve ever known, forever comfortable 61-year-old skin. My mother also housewife choice, one since day got married. Surprised? More often not, think housewives around us – whether mothers, grandmothers, aunts neighbours – though cut domesticated cloth. Many millennial generation think cater husbands, houses, kids, otherwise “do nothing all”. Even movies grew show homemakers in-law-worshipping, always submissive husbands families, weak, rarely opinionated strong personalities, personality all. Thanks, Bollywood. But can’t showcase, okay with, badass women choosing housewives? I’ve asked mom many occasions, like tend question homemakers, whether she’s ever dreamt pursuing career income. “Do think brought money? I provided everything else,” comes proud response. My mother perfectly happy provider everything apart salary – ambition mother, every time kids needed her. She work got married, first teaching kindergarten desk job while, never developed liking work life. She’s never regretted choice, let anyone make feel ashamed guilty it. And shouldn’t either. What’s home? Till brother I almost adults, didn’t driver, cook, full-time domestic help. It mom – like countless homemakers – travelled BEST buses drop fetch us birthday parties swimming classes, walked bazaars stock kitchen cook meals, helped homework whenever needed, attended PTA meetings, accompanied us doctor, cared us sick. And still made time – read, beloved newspaper crosswords sudokus, meet friends, shop, write daily diary, whatever else wanted. If women choose housewives truly owning it, look them? From young age, brother I taught independent self-reliant, mom forcing travel alone bus age 10 I didn’t need fetch friends’ houses. She stayed sibling fights “because need learn deal problems yourself”, made brother several household chores (PSA: kids “free house help” middle-class families). She taught fill pass books rounds banks financial work pre-netbanking era. I could go questions I boys, periods, sex, everything else sun, even got little weird. And matter many times I asked she’d ever great ambitions outside four walls home, one answer: happiest homemaker, qualms wearing badge pride. If women choose housewives truly owning it, look them? We shame kind choosing “sit home nothing” (have ever seen housewife’s schedule?), assume she’s confined home life outside factors – qualifications finding job, family objections she’s unambitious. Why can’t treat homemakers around us respect give CEO who’s killing boardroom lawyer spends hours poring case files? There though, say housewife thankless unpaid job, express gratitude ladies spend days home, everything us. But need respect one gives career-woman choices makes – isn’t feminism about? Let’s proud women making life decisions free will, whether choose fly plane 30,000 feet sea level run home way wish. They never needed permission anyway. At least mom doesn’t.

In article I look women stay home, looking judgement receive others decision also made choice ‘work’ typical sense word, importantly really means stay home mam/housewife. Stay home mothers housewives often face judgement choice like every aspect life face stereotyping especially derived media. Television shows ‘The real housewives of...’ painted image choose stay home one glamour, wealth excess priority women one goal rarely tends benefits around them. This is, however, rarely reflection majority women live. Keeping ideas representation media women I Spoke Darlene Smith Meadows, stay home wife mother Mid-Georgia USA, say “I honestly work harder home I ever I working outside home. Ladies Leisure? Maybe are… I definitely not.” There many different viewpoints reasons behind others staying home, asking handful people variation answers opinions remarkable ‘being lazy’ ‘making huge sacrifice staying home put effort family life’. There shortage differing opinions. Even women choosing stay home means different thing them. One Housewife, Lisa Jones Melbourne Australia, believes housewife 21^st century “A decision put needs family first provide household ways financial.” Mrs Meadows believes “It looks different woman it. I could stay home wife/mama still send children school, buy everything rather making it, I choose be, thrifty wife, concerned informed wife mother.” While Samantha Chapman stay home mother Sunderland told us “It still important I teach children working earning something need section life. It helps understand value money. It hectic life, I love children dearly understand people opinion”. These three women chose stay home, differing views important means stay home mother housewife. So, differing opinions research say? A Poll Gallup revealed stay home mams report feeling sadness anger everyday women work outside home. 60,000 women surveyed including working mams, say home mams, women children. While majority stay home mams reported feelings stress previous day, important realise numbers bigger differences isn’t huge. 42% stay home mams reported struggling number working mothers 36% The study concludes important every stay-at-home mam established support network, including regular outings friends get much-needed break prevent ‘mommy burnout’. Lisa told “until recently, I always worked full time juggling 90% house running load lead lot burn disappointment home life seemed come second work life. When I worked, I would killed kind like balance! Living dream really!” So, woman copes works differently, speaking women one thing seem agree often brought up. That still stigma attached home. We spoke stigma Beth Larson stay home mam Neoga IL. Her opinion topic “There definitely stigma carefully taught throughout educational system ‘stay home moms’. The premise intelligent enough anything else. I remember told many times ‘the speaker’ jealous able lay couch eating bon-bons watching TV day. (Like I ever time that!)” Mrs Jones also similar experiences another part world similar stereotyping “People sorts opinions. Mostly surrounding marriage (husband controlling, lazy abusive), something secretly wrong health mental health. It’s mostly women can’t understand financially contributing household men think I’m sort slave.” A desire family flexibility first reason 90% stay home mothers choose so. Choosing work home choice comes looking happiness struggling balance work parenting. Melinda Pittser Pennsylvania told us hard works home, ‘waking 5:30 get ready day making sure children ready start day.’ Making sure families happy full-time job women. The stereotyping stigma facing women stay home many parts world England Australia. Media huge contribution towards something corporations need address, increase women choosing stay home becoming important stigma begins change become positive one see’s reasoning behind women’s choice. For many women staying home comes desire also convenience. Looking household full-time job women many choose add work top. It’s choice woman makes best suit life.

By Samantha Kamman, Christian Post Reporter Housewife, baking Getty Images A TikTok trend stay-at-home moms sharing daily routine performing domestic work prompted debate whether encourages women submissive. As Insider reported earlier month, women showcasing lives homemakers part trend American women making “trad wife” (traditional wife) content showing positive aspects housewife. The trad wife hashtag 96 million views TikTok, users incorporating usernames. Estee C. Williams, 24-year-old creates content TikTok, defines trad wife woman “who chooses live traditional life ultra-traditional gender roles." Williams lives Virginia husband, Conner. In June, homemaker posted video listing things make life enjoyable, including listening music cleaning, wearing makeup cute house dresses, taking candle-lit baths. In interview Insider, Williams said disparaging women’s right work, adds housewives like believe many “women drifted far [our] roots.” "For me, hustle culture appealing. Being wife, mom, making delicious home-cooked meals family, keeping warm, inviting home truly spoke me,” Williams said. The social media influencer added working good women, fears many workforce suffer burnout. "I choose promote lifestyle showcase fulfillment lifestyle gives,” said. According 2020 analysis conducted Great Place Work healthcare start-up Maven, mothers paid employment 23% likely experience burnout fathers paid employment. The study surveyed 1,200 U.S. companies 400,000 working parents. The analysis included 226,000 working mothers 204,000 working fathers, respond 60 questions Great Place Work’s Trust Index survey. An estimated 2.35 million working mothers U.S. suffered burnout start COVID-19 pandemic, mainly “due unequal demands home work,” according study. Another survey conducted business networking site LinkedIn assessed nearly 5,000 members site July 31 Aug. 13 last year. The study found working women men face similar stresses, intensity level always higher women. Seventy-four percent women said felt “very somewhat stressed” work-related reasons, compared 64% working men. Forty percent working women cited “not enough time day get everything done” one top stress factors, versus 35% male respondents. The Insider report noted trad wives believe feminism persuaded women enter workforce instead full-time wives mothers. Deborah Etienne, Brandwatch data analyst researcher tracking social media trend, asserted "many trad wives reject feminism, claiming destroyed everything." Whitman College sociologist Michelle Janning told Insider chaos pandemic might influenced women full-time stay-at-home mothers. According Janning, stress working outside home time might led women decide home best option. "As sociologist, I would say, people collectively feel like there's lot control world, cling something familiar, concrete might comfortable," told Insider. Janning also cautioned trad wives creating content promote homemaking healthy lifestyle. She claimed might use trend champion "conservative white supremacist views." Another TikTok user identified trad wife, Madison Dastrup, stopped associating term September reason. The sociologist added women TikTok actually pursuing career “outside home” working social media influencers. "It could they're selling product selling version themselves, husband getting sponsorship,” Janning said. “It's contradiction: job tell people job." She went insinuate society’s “gender system” tells women homemaker lifestyle choice, it’s really pushing toward role full-time housewife. "It's less choice maybe think is,” Janning said. Abby Roth, conservative host "Classically Abby" podcast, promotes classic feminist values, examined #TradWide trend May 2020 article Evie. Roth claimed versions trend “demean women” instead merely celebrating stay-at-home moms. Some definitions trend, Roth explained, claim women traditional stay home full-time. “A classic woman traditional wife mother even work knows passion work support traditional life home,” wrote. “Where feminism proposes women actively choose career family, classic says work family go hand-in-hand.” The feminist emphasized husband wife must commit growing alongside one another, encouraging become better versions themselves. She argued #Trad trend appears discourage women speaking husbands improve character. “Because #Trad definition expects wives submissive husbands dominant, creates inherent power imbalance relationship,” Roth wrote time. She asserted marriages “should based partnership, subservience.” According YouGov survey Institute Family Studies/Wheatley Institution 2,500 American adults, ages 18-55, conducted May 28 June 10 last year, 53% parents children younger 18 prefer working home time half time due pandemic.

During lockdown, mothers UK typically providing least 50% childcare well spending around 10% 30% time fathers home schooling children, figures analysed Observer show. It doesn’t matter whether woman working home, working outside home working all: research reveals typically spending least extra hour-and-a-half childcare home schooling every day, compared average man circumstances. The research, carried economists universities Cambridge, Oxford Zurich 9 14 April, indicates woman home – whether formally working – affected gender divide. Both employed unemployed mothers typically spending around six hours providing childcare home schooling every working day. By contrast, average father home spending little four hours childcare homeschooling working day, regardless employment status. “Whatever situation have, average it’s woman more, it’s she’s working less” says Dr Christopher Rauh, economist Cambridge University. Men seem able lock away study, women working kitchen table – also trying home educate Mary-Ann Stephenson, Women's Budget Group The gender divide even larger high-income households. A mother earns £80,000 working home typically 3.3 hours home schooling 3.8 hours childcare day – seven hours total. A typical father earns £80,000 spends 2.1 hours home schooling children 2.3 hours childcare working day – less 4.5 hours total. “The higher household income, time women spending home schooling compared men,” says Rauh. “People come explanations – like women better taking care children due evolution – true, shouldn’t apply home schooling. Yet also see differences here.” The amount home schooling children receiving lockdown appears particularly affected income mothers, lowest-paid women spending 2.1 hours day educating children day (over hour less highest-paid women). Fathers earning £0 £20,000 even less homeschooling (1.9 hours), that’s still roughly higher-paid men. The starkest gender divide among low-paid parents, however, around childcare. Like highest-paid women, women earning £0 £20,000 3.9 hours childcare day. By contrast, lowest-paid men carrying 2.4 hours childcare day. In words, woman earning £80,000 working home typically spending 60% time (an extra 1.4 hours) childcare working day average man earning £0 £20,000. Mary-Ann Stephenson, director Women’s Budget Group, thinks may women used juggle looking children work men. “It may emergency woman takes childcare work,” says. Children may also inclined go mothers fathers, says. Similarly, father paid more, might seen important doesn’t lose job. The home-learning platform Atom Learning says since lockdown began, three-quarters parents registered children free online lessons set schoolwork female. At time, evidence women’s contributions outside home decreasing. There drop number solo-authored academic papers submitted women, submissions male academics increased.

Based Oakley’s PhD research, pioneering feminist book looks role housewife modern industrialised society. “The study domestic labour taken seriously — wasn’t understood topic, fact,” Oakley tells sit office Institute Education London professor sociology social policy. During research, Oakley, 70, interviewed 40 women living suburban London. She found tended dissatisfied monotony, fragmentation social isolation inherent role housewife. Therefore, “housework directly opposed possibility human self-actualisation,” concluded call abolish housewife role. “I deliberately provocative,” explains book’s final chapter also called abolition traditional family abolition traditional gender roles. Four decades later, what’s changed? “I think whole notion women housewives changed,” replies. “If asked women talk housewives wouldn’t know talking really.” But concedes men housework today, explains it’s still equal. “I don’t think study world shows it’s equal.” Sure enough, newly published 2014 Global Trends survey, 70 per cent British women said mostly responsible cooking, food shopping household cleaning. These findings supported research Organisation Economic Co-operation Development (2013) Institute Public Policy Research (2012), show British women still lion’s share domestic labour. “Most change happened since ’70s been, view, fairly superficial,” Oakley says. “The change behaviour probably less professed attitude — people say egalitarian do.” In particular, Oakley’s 1970s research interested inequality responsibility. “In far men housework construed men women helping housework — way round. “In terms issue responsibility, happened 1970s still happening now.” When men pitch in, studies show generally end tasks arguably enjoyable leisurely — gardening DIY, example. Oakley agrees. “In area childcare, it’s still case men likely enjoyable side childcare, rather changing dirty nappies.” So grossly unfair status quo continue? “Patriarchy simple explanation,” Oakley argues. “Men privileged group reason give privilege unless forced so.” This feminism comes in. “Most change men’s behaviour, I suspect, come women involved put pressure change. Men haven’t, en masse, decided housework good thing do.” Oakley sees increasing men’s involvement housework childcare important step addressing social problem masculinity — topic explored 2011 Guardian article co-written fellow feminist academic Cynthia Cockburn. Quoting government statistics, noted: “Men perpetrators 91 per cent violent incidents England Wales … 81 per cent domestic violence, 86 per cent assault, 94 per cent wounding, 96 per cent mugging, 98 per cent robbery.” In addition, Ministry Justice figures show men responsible 98 per cent sexual offences, 92 per cent drug offences 89 per cent criminal damage. “The evidence involved basic care work, involved close relationships dependent people including children, something brings qualities traditionally associated woman — caring, altruism that,” Oakley says. “That happens men too, first willing put position changes occur.” According 2011 research Churchill Home Insurers, one seven population pay outside hired help housework. Oakley doesn’t buy solution problem. “That’s solution often people hired women underpaid, job conditions security good,” says. “And usually woman household responsible looking hired help. So you’ve simply passed oppression sense.” Oakley’s politics research interests energised second-wave feminism early 1970s. Forty years later, many commentators argue currently midst fourth-wave feminism, groups campaigns UK Feminista, Everyday Sexism No More Page 3 evidence renewed feminist activism. “I don’t know enough really,” Oakley admits I ask resurgent movement. However, feels media discussions around contemporary feminism aware little common women’s liberation movement ’70s. She points current focus representation women positions power. “We arguing women’s share top jobs. We talking basic issues, arguing level basic reproductive rights access childcare — state-provided childcare. It something domestic oppression undoing privilege top.” Rather getting bigger portion pie, argues, “it changing pie. We wanted different kind pie.” She philosophical I suggest work, work many feminists generation, rarely cited popular feminist polemics published today. “Time moves — it’s one sad things much rediscovered time again,” says. In fact says found one book referred dead — “The late Ann Oakley.” “I’m late sense I’m dead also I’m quite punctual person,” quips. Having read Housewife Oakley’s stupendously good Gender Planet Earth — book moves men meat-eating critiquing post-modernism — I safely say contemporary feminism missing lot ignoring Oakley’s groundbreaking work. As recent surveys mentioned show, housework continues source inequality men women. Housewife could therefore key text revival feminist concern housework must take place women gain semblance equality future.
