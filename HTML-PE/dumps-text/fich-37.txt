   need strict planning. In fact, L.A. is very spread out and doesn’t have
   one city center that organically connects all must-see attractions in
   the city. Unlike other major north American cities like San Francisco
   and New York, without proper planning you could feel that you’ve wasted
   most of your vacation commuting. We’re here to help! Keep this travel
   guide to hand to make sure you don’t miss out on anything.

   In last decade, Los Angeles welcomed record-setting numbers of visitors
   each year. Many tourists from all over the world find L.A. familiar and
   bewildering at the same time. But why is that? Well, did you know that
   Los Angeles is one the most diverse places in the world? L.A. residents
   come from over 140 countries and speak a whopping 224 different
   languages. According to a census from 2010, the population of L.A. is:
     * 49.8% White
     * 9.6% African American
     * 0.7% Native American
     * 11.3% Asian
     * 0.1% Pacific Islander
     * 23.8% other races
     * 4.6% from two or more races

   Unsurprisingly, Hispanic people or Latinos of any race make up to 48.5%
   of Los Angeles population.

   Los Angeles inspires its many visitors to immerse themselves in its
   diverse culture, explore the never-ending natural amenities it offers
   and generally to enjoy the open-hearted welcome of all its communities.
   What else do you want to know about the city? Here’s a breakdown of the
   most important figures of the city of angels.

Geography, climate & population

   Los Angeles City is both flat and hilly, but for higher mountains you
   need to actually leave the urban center. In the north, you’ll find the
   San Gabriel Mountains, where the highest peak, Mount San Antonio (aka.
   Mount Baldy), reaches 10 064 feet (3 068 m). Thanks to the city’s
   diversity of habitats, including lush beaches and mountains, Los
   Angeles has a rich variety of native plants. Unfortunately, some of
   these plants have become so rare that they’re considered endangered.
   Lastly, it’s worth mentioning that Los Angeles is sometimes subject to
   earthquakes, but most low-intensity earthquakes can barely be felt.

Size & Cityscape

   Los Angeles is the largest city in the state of California. It extends
   for around 470 sq miles, that’s around 1200 sq km. The city is composed
   by many districts, some of which used to be towns and cities in their
   own right, and that have merged with Los Angeles as it grew over time.
   This gives to Los Angeles its decentralized character, where each
   neighborhood has as many touristic attractions and opportunities as the
   other.

Climate & Geology

   Los Angeles is known for its Mediterranean climate, with dry summers
   and very mild winters. In winter, temperatures average around 68 °F (20
   °C), giving the city a tropical vibe without reaching the scorching
   temperatures of a true tropical climate. Summer usually goes by with no
   rain at all, but the seasonal change in late summer brings brief
   thunderstorms.

   The many fault systems running throughout Los Angeles lead to several
   earthquakes per year. Los Angeles is in fact located on the Pacific
   Ring of Fire, giving the area a certain geological instability.
   Although many people in LA County feel the ground shaking a couple
   times a year, most of these earthquakes are mild or moderate and cause
   little damage.

   Due to its climate and geology, Los Angeles is particularly vulnerable
   to the consequences of climate change.

Population & Standards of Living

   As the second most populous city in the United States (ranking after
   New York City) Los Angeles is home to roughly 3.9 million people as of
   2020, but against popular belief, not everyone in Los Angeles is rich.

   It’s true that the top 5% of earners in LA cane make more than
   $500,000, and that to be financially comfortable in the city you’d need
   a net worth of roughly $1.3 million, however the annual salary in Los
   Angeles averages at $67,057.

   This means, that a good part of the almost 4 million people living in
   Los Angeles doesn’t earn enough to live comfortably in the city. The
   minimum wage in the state of California is $14-15 an hour depending on
   the size of the company.

Los Angeles districts and suburbs

   Until the 1920s, Los Angeles had a fairly ‘traditional’ urban pattern,
   with one centralized commercial area. However, with the economic
   expansion that turned Los Angeles into a manufacturing center, came
   also a rapidly increasing number of residents. Especially with the
   immigration wave of the 50s, many manufacturing firms were built in the
   suburbs where cheaper accommodation was more readily available for the
   workers. The traditional, centralized and walkable city gave way to a
   decentralized network of communities, tightly connected with the
   freeway also built in the 50s. From chic Hollywood to the hippest food
   trucks, Los Angeles diverse population has given rise to unique
   districts that have their own vibe, lifestyle and culture.

Hollywood

   Have you even seen Los Angeles if you didn’t walk through Hollywood?
   The stars and starlets of the American showbiz have famously made Los
   Angeles their home of choice – and this district is where you’ll find
   them. As soon as you can, head towards the Hollywood Sign. A picture
   with this cultural icon is a must.

Venice

   Located in the Westside of Los Angeles, this district is called Venice
   due to its canals, beach and Ocean Front Walk. Palm trees, skaters,
   street musicians, delicious street food and street art: Venice is where
   all the locals flock to. Enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and feel like a
   true Angeleno on the beach.

Downtown L.A. or the Art District

   This district is as cool as its name sounds. This is urban area is
   known for its colourful street art all the art galleries that make up
   the art scene in Los Angeles. This is considered one of the best areas
   to stay in while in L.A., as it is packed with attractions such as the
   Grand Central Market and the Staples Center, as well as some of very
   best bars and restaurants in the city.

Chinatown

   This district is only a stone's throw away from downtown and is widely
   appreciated for its huge offering of Asian delicacies. Immerse yourself
   in the vibrant culture of the district walking along Hill Street and
   Broadway, north of Cesar Chavez Avenue. If you happen to be here in the
   summer, swing by Chinatown Plaza and you’ll have your pick of festivals
   and events.

San Fernando Valley, or the Valley

   In the Valley is where you’ll find many of the most iconic film studios
   such as Warner Bros and Walt Disney. In addition, it is home to the
   Universal Studios Hollywood theme park. In actuality, only 80% of the
   Valley belongs to the urban area of Los Angeles, and only recently many
   numerous development projects are also including this district.

Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Bel Air and Pasadena

   Contrary to popular belief, none of these towns are districts of Los
   Angeles. These are independent communities that belong to Los Angeles
   County beyond the city limits. Nonetheless, these suburban areas are
   all worth visiting if you wish to feel like a local.

Where to sleep in Los Angeles

   Due to its decentralized nature, it’s not as easy to choose where to
   stay in Los Angeles as it would be in another major city. There are
   many things to do in L.A. in many different districts. Fortunately,
   you’ll find all kinds of accommodations located in all districts of
   L.A. and at drastically different prizing points.

   Los Angeles offers, in fact, hundreds of hotels with more thousands of
   rooms to choose from. The city’s hotel offer grows bigger each year
   following the increasing demand of the tourism industry. That’s why our
   best recommendation, when choosing where to sleep in L.A., is not to
   choose the best hotel, but to rather look at the best district.

   What’s the point of sleeping comfortably if you spend all your time
   commuting during your stay? To give you a better idea of the district
   for you, here are some of the best attractions of the city and where
   they’re located:
              Attraction                L.A. District
   Walk of Fame                     Hollywood
   Hollywood Sign                   Hollywood
   Universal Studios                Hollywood
   OUE Skyspace                     Downtown L.A.
   Rodeo Drive                      Beverly Hills
   Santa Monica Pier & Beach        Santa Monica
   Venice Beach & Boardwalk         Venice
   Disneyland Park                  Anaheim (outside L.A.)
   Griffith Observatory             Hollywood
   Getty Center                     Brentwood
   The Huntington                   San Marino
   Grand Central Market             Downtown L.A.
   Hollywood Bowl                   Hollywood Hills
   Los Angeles County Museum of Art Wilshire Boulevard
   The Broad                        Downtown L.A.

Top attractions & cultural highlights in Los Angeles

   Los Angeles has a never-ending list of attractions that ensure
   year-round entertainment. Such a culturally diverse city was always
   bound to become a creative powerhouse of the US and, of course, you
   wish to see it all. However, the sprawling city of Los Angeles makes
   reaching all its key destinations a challenge in itself, not to mention
   the scorching temperature that might render waiting times almost
   unbearable during the warmest months. Luckily, recent upgrades to the
   public transport system have made getting around a lot easier. To help
   you plan a reasonable sightseeing itinerary, we’ve prepared a list of
   top attractions and cultural highlights in Los Angeles.

Venice Beach

   If the reason you’re visiting Los Angeles is to enjoy a walk between
   the palm trees, watch the skaters racing around doing stunts, and
   explore the coast of L.A. while eating Poke Bowls, Venice Beach is the
   right choice for you. Sunseekers will find plenty of things to do, in
   fact if you plan your trip in advance, make sure to book some surf
   lessons or yoga classes to get the most out of your L.A. experience.

   → Highlights of Venice Beach: the Boardwalk, the Muscle Beach, and the
   Venice Skate Park.

Walk of Fame

   What is a trip to L.A. without a visit to the Hollywood Boulevard and
   the Walk of Fame? Probably one of few free attractions of Los Angeles,
   the Walk of Fame is runs fifteen blocks along Hollywood Boulevard,
   along which you can find many restaurants, classic movie theaters,
   museums and – of course – celebrity impersonators! If you time your
   trip with the Academy Awards, this is where you’ll find the Dolby
   Theater - where the famous ceremony is held.

   Highlights of the Walk of Fame: celebrity stars and impersonators, the
   Hollywood Highland Center, and the Dolby Theater tour.

Beverly Hills

   Just about anything you associate with luxury, fame and wealth can be
   found in Beverly Hills. In fact, it’s well-known that Hollywood stars
   have made Mulholland Drive in Beverly Hills their home and some stars’
   villas are even open for tourists to visit. If you enjoy celebrity
   gossip and shopping, you’re in for a treat.

   → Highlights of Beverly Hills: Rodeo Drive, Greystone Mansion and
   Gardens, Will Rogers Memorial Park, and the Trolley Tours.

Hollywood Sign

   There is nothing more iconic and so quintessentially L.A. than this
   sign towering over the hills. To get a good shot of the sign we
   recommend travelling along Mulholland Highway or trying your luck on a
   clear day in the Griffith Observatory and Lake Hollywood Park. And
   although some tourists will choose to spare themselves the hike up the
   hill to get a close-up of the Hollywood sign, getting a picture of it
   when they visit the Highland Center instead, we highly recommend the
   trip. A tour to walk up to the Hollywood Sign takes about 2 to 3 hours,
   but it is definitely worth your time.

   → Walk-up the Hollywood Sign: 4 miles total, 2-3 hours, little to no
   shade. Bring sunscreen, hat or other head coverage, and lots of water.

Universal Studios Hollywood

   Did you know that the Universal Studios is the only working movie
   studio and theme park in the world? We can’t recommend it enough,
   because there’s really something for everyone at the Universal Studios.
   Take an insightful tour, try the most thrilling rides and, of course,
   enjoy family-friendly attractions where the little ones are as welcome
   as you are.

   → Highlights of Universal Studios: The Wizarding World of Harry Potter,
   Jurassic World – The Ride, Springfield (The Simpson’s ride), and the
   Studio Tour.

Disneyland Park

   This is a favorite attraction for tourists and Angelenos alike. It
   doesn’t matter how often you’ve been to the Disneyland Resort, there
   will always be something new to see. This enormous multi-park resort
   complex is a place to marvel at. Just avoid visiting the park without a
   plan and make sure to make the most of your trip by buying tickets
   online first.

   → Recommendations for Disneyland Park: plan a 2-day visit and book a
   hotel nearby, get to the park before it opens and get a locker. Check
   the Disneyland app for wait times at attractions.

Santa Monica Pier & Beach

   One of the most popular activities at Santa Monica Pier is fishing, ad
   has been since the early 1900s when it was first built. However, you
   should be sure to get your camera ready to snap the most stunning views
   of the ocean and the Santa Monica Mountains while you’re there too. For
   the foody tourists: don’t miss out on the Santa Monica farmers’ market.

   → Highlights of Santa Monica Pier: the Looff Hippodrome, the Santa
   Monica Yacht Harbor neon sign, and the Original Muscle Beach.

Most iconic street food in Los Angeles

   Mexican Food Photo by Jarritos Mexican Soda on Unsplash. Free to use

   Food is cultural, and culture can be transmitted through food. Los
   Angeles has some of the best street food on offer in the US. In fact,
   as people from all over the world have settled here and brought the
   most amazing food from their respective countries with them, the street
   food scene in L.A. deserves a whole tour for itself. Basically what
   we’re trying to say is: yes, tacos are amazing, but there’s so much
   more food to explore on the streets of Los Angeles.
   Elote: a simple vegetable treat, prepared with crumbled cotija cheese,
   mayonnaise, lime and margarine Raspados: the Mexican version of shaved
   ice, a staple for many Angelenos during the torrid Californian summers
   Tamales: an easy, choose-your-own-filling quick bite (often chicken or
   pork) that will keep your hunger at bay until your next meal Tejuions:
   a fermented drink made from boiling brown sugar topped fresh lime
   juice, salt and ice
   Bacon-wrapped hot dogs: ever-present in every food guide of L.A., these
   hot dogs taste divine after a night out drinking Churros: fried dough
   covered in cinnamon, and sugar? Um, yes please.

   A special place on every food guide of Los Angeles is reserved for
   tacos. We’re sure that this needs no introduction. The taco scene in
   Los Angeles is rich and vibrant, thanks to the typical taco stands
   spread throughout the city, but also to new Instagram-ready street
   vendors that gain thousands of followers overnight. Whether you wish to
   get your taco from a taco stand or at a hidden spot only for those
   in-the-know, you’re in for a treat.

Best and trendy restaurants in Los Angeles

   Los Angeles attracts all sorts of people for all sorts of reasons, and
   if you’re a foody, you’re in luck! Los Angeles offers many restaurants
   that take a provocative stance in the global food scene, where many
   chefs and restaurants have also the opportunity to become media
   personalities. For those who enjoy food as an experience and are
   looking for the “next big thing”, Los Angeles is the place to be.
   Curious to see what the city of angels has to offer in terms of fancy
   and romantic restaurants? From Santa Monica to Downtown L.A., from
   Hollywood to Venice and beyond, here are some of the trendiest
   restaurants in Los Angeles.
   Fine Dining Food

Romantic restaurants in Los Angeles

     * Nobu Malibu: the perfect choice when looking for a table with a
       view. Enjoy the ocean waves just a few steps from the Malibu Pier
       in this famous temple of food. The legendary fish menu of Nobu
       Malibu will take you on a journey through Peruvian-inspired recipes
       and it has a particular L.A. twist we all know and love.
     * Hansei: a pearl of Little Tokyo where your dinner will literally
       take you from the lush outdoor gardens of the starters to the
       “chef's counter” inside for the main courses, and then back outside
       to the garden for dessert. You can set your own pace for enjoying
       all the elements of this luxurious and dynamic dining experience.
     * LA Cha Cha Chá: you’re looking for the most Mexican experience in
       Los Angeles? Sneak into this Mexican escape in the Arts District of
       L.A. to enjoy the seafood and the wander-lusting aesthetic and hop
       on a short trip to paradise.

Michelin-starred restaurants in Los Angeles

     * Ardor: you’re bound to wow your date with this Michelin-starred
       restaurant, a favourite with vegetarians. Why? Just have a look at
       the breathtaking interior garden and the vegetable-focused menu.
     * n/naka: famous from featuring on season 1 of Netflix's Chef’s Table
       (first season), the owner and chef of this restaurant is Niki
       Nakayama, who wows with a particular style of Japanese cooking
       called kaiseki. The chef will decide the progression of tastes and
       textures you’ll enjoy during your 13 course-meal. Interested? We
       sure are!
     * Cut: if this is your first time in the US, you can’t miss on a good
       ol’ steakhouse. Beverly Hills is home to many but this one if
       certainly a cut above the rest. Their international take on the
       American classic allows every diner to choose more than just how
       the steak is cooked, but also where the meat comes from.
     * Gucci Osteria: at the intersection of fine dining and fashion, as
       one would expect from its name, we find Gucci Osteria. The
       world-renowned chef Massimo Bottura also runs an osteria in
       Florence (first of its name) and is sure to bring only the best of
       Tuscany’s cuisine to your table with, of course, the inevitable and
       enjoyable Californian twist.
     * Pasjoli: for French cuisine lovers, Pasjoli is a bistro that will
       elevate even the most understated onion soup. You can’t go wrong in
       choosing any dish if you dine at the Pasjoli, but we definitely
       recommend the foie de poulet à la Strasbourgeoise. This is a dish
       you’ve just got to try, promise.

Nightlife in Los Angeles

   As one of the nightlife capitals in the world, we have no doubt that
   you’ll find exactly what you’re looking for in Los Angeles. Literally
   every night is party time here. The city has a virtually endless offer
   of entertainment, from extravagant one-in-a-lifetime spaces to
   sophisticated venues with themed décor. In particular, L.A.’s
   LGBTQ-friendly bars welcome guests of all identities and orientations
   on their dance floors. In fact, once headquartered in West Hollywood,
   the LGBTQ scene has become as decentralized as Los Angeles itself.
   You’ll know find headliners of the queer scene in in Silver Lake,
   Downtown L.A. and other venues sprinkled everywhere in the city.

   Given the big competition, you’ll find that promotional deals are in
   abundance, allowing you to enjoy the city nightlife on a budget, too.
   However, if you’re ready to splurge, google your favorite DJ or music
   group: all the major headliners are bound to pass through the city of
   angels sooner or later.

       Margaritaville are our bar recommendations.

       Angeles, if you’re in the mood for a laugh swing by the Laugh

Sports in Los Angeles

   Los Angeles is a popular tourist destination for a wide variety of
   reasons. The city simply has that much to offer, including something
   for sports fans. L.A. is the homebase of many sport teams (which are
   attractions in and of themselves) and regularly hosts great sport
   events. So, for those who enjoy stadium tours and a good ol’ game of
   baseball, basketball, football, ice hockey etc. – this one is for you.

Baseball

   Baseball fans all over the world have probably heard of the Dodger
   Stadium. The Dodger Stadium, home to the L.A. Dodgers, is one of the
   most well-known baseball pitches in the US as well as the filming
   location of some old-time favorites like The Fast and The Furious, City
   of Angels and Superman Returns.

   But if you’re in Los Angeles and you’re a baseball fan, you might as
   well round up your trip with the Angel Stadium of Anaheim, or The Big
   A, home to the Angels since 1966. You might even catch a SoCal baseball
   game – this is one of the US travel baseball organizations, that
   focuses on student-athletes.

Basketball

   Looking for a must-see spot to make your basketball buddy happy? The
   Staples Center in Downtown L.A. is where to go. This is home to the
   L.A. Lakers, who have given to the fans some of most famous basketball
   players in the world: Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
   and Shaquille O’Neal.

   Currently, LeBron dominates the scene – securing tickets to see the
   Lakers play at the Staples Center is your key to the opportunity to
   watch him play live.

American Football

   Two NFL teams call Los Angeles home: the Los Angeles Rams and the Los
   Angeles Chargers. The former home of the Rams is also in L.A. - the Los
   Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which is the oldest football stadium in the
   National Football League and definitely worth a visit.

   Currently, the two NFL teams share the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. The
   SoFi Stadium is the newest and largest stadium to ever host NFL games.
   To give you an idea of its size, the stadium is three times the size of
   Disneyland

Ice Hockey & Soccer

   Although ice hockey is less popular than American football here, L.A.
   is in fact home to the L.A. Kings and the Anaheim Ducks. This means
   that if you’re a hockey fan, the city still has plenty to offer you. To
   catch one of these NHL team games live, we recommend heading to the
   Crypto.com Arena or the Honda Center.

   In short, fans of all sports with be able to find something to enjoy
   during their visit of L.A.. Los Angeles is home to at least one top
   league team from every premier American sport - with a recent new
   addition! L.A. is now also home to a professional soccer club, Los
   Angeles FC, which competes in the Major League Soccer (MLS). So, soccer
   lovers, don’t forget to swing by the Bank of California Stadium. This
   is the first open-air stadium to be built in Los Angeles since 1962 and
   its opening ceremony in 2016 was groundbreaking. The stadium is also
   conveniently located next to the Coliseum.

Estimated VAT overview

     * )
    Value Added Tax
       The Value Added Tax (VAT) is a consumption tax applied in the
       European Union (EU) to all goods and services.
       Who has to pay VAT?
          + All consumers in the EU are charged VAT on the purchase of
            goods and services.
          + Businesses in the EU buying from a business in the same
            country are also charged VAT.
          + Businesses in the EU buying from a business in a different EU
            country are not charged VAT.
          + Consumers and businesses outside of the European Union are not
            charged VAT.
       Is your VAT calculation wrong?
       The VAT rate provided on this page is only an estimation. It will
       be corrected during the checkout process after entering your
       billing details.

     * )
    Use the domain shortly after payment
       After the first payment, our system automatically transfers the
       domain to our own holding registrar to keep it safe and available
       for you. Once the transfer is done (this can vary per domain since
       some registrars approve transfers only after 5 days) you can manage
       the DNS of the domain via your Buyer Control Panel.
     * )
    Domain transfer after the final installment is paid
       When the final installment is paid for, we will assist you with
       transferring the domain to a registrar of your choice and changing
       the ownership records of the domain.
     * )
    Stop at any time
       You can cancel an installment transaction whenever you want. This
       is only available for buyers. Sellers can’t cancel the contract, as
       long as you do not miss any final monthly payment deadline(s). When
       you opt to cancel a transaction, the received installments will be
       kept by the seller. You won’t receive the ownership of the domain
       and the domain will be returned to the original seller.
     * )
    Long term service fee
       Long term service fee is a fee percentage added when you pick a
       period longer than 1 year. The fee is included in the price you see
       in the Lease to Own dialog.
       Pricing example of Lease to Own models

       Domain price  Installments  Service fee
       $1,000       1 - 12 months  $0 (0%)

       $1,000       37 - 60 months $300 (30%)
       What does the service fee cost cover?
       The service fee covers the transfer & renewal expenses of the
       domain, hosting DNS, providing support for years, and the recurring
       monthly payment processing expenses that Dan.com makes to
       facilitate this type of transaction.
